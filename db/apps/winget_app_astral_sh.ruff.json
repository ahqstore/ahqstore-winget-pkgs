This ensures Ruff's code is consistent with\n    the same rule in the `tryceratops` linter.\n- The `lint.allow-unused-imports` setting has been removed (#13677). Use\n    `lint.pyflakes.allow-unused-imports`\n    instead.\n\nFormatter preview style\n- Normalize implicit concatenated f-string quotes per part (#13539)\n\nPreview linter features\n- [refurb] implement `hardcoded-string-charset` (FURB156) (#13530)\n- [refurb] Count codepoints not bytes for `slice-to-remove-prefix-or-suffix (FURB188)` (#13631)\n\nRule changes\n- [pylint] Mark PLE1141 fix as unsafe (#13629)\n- [flake8-async] Consider async generators to be \"checkpoints\" for `cancel-scope-no-checkpoint` (ASYNC100) (#13639)\n- [flake8-bugbear] Do not suggest setting parameter `strict=` to `False` in B905 diagnostic message (#13656)\n- [flake8-todos] Only flag the word \"TODO\", not words starting with \"todo\" (TD006) (#13640)\n- [pycodestyle] Fix whitespace-related false positives and false negatives inside type-parameter lists (E231, E251) (#13704)\n- [flake8-simplify] Stabilize preview behavior for SIM115 so that the rule can detect files\n    being opened from a wider range of standard-library functions (#12959).\n\nCLI\n- Add explanation of fixable in `--statistics` command (#13774)\n\nBug fixes\n- [pyflakes] Allow `ipytest` cell magic (F401) (#13745)\n- [flake8-use-pathlib] Fix PTH123 false positive when `open` is passed a file descriptor (#13616)\n- [flake8-bandit] Detect patterns from multi line SQL statements (S608) (#13574)\n- [flake8-pyi] - Fix dropped expressions in PYI030 autofix (#13727)","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"0.7.0","site":"https://github.com/astral-sh","source":"WinGet","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
