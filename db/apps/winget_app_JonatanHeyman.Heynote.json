It functions as a large persistent text buffer where you can write down anything you like. Works great for that Slack message you don't want to accidentally send, a JSON response from an API you're working with, notes from a meeting, your daily to-do list, etc.\nThe Heynote buffer is divided into blocks, and each block can have its own Language set (e.g. JavaScript, JSON, Markdown, etc.). This gives you syntax highlighting and lets you auto-format that JSON response.\nAvailable for Mac, Windows, and Linux.\nWhat's Changed\n- Block parsing optimization by @heyman in https://github.com/heyman/heynote/pull/241\n- Add documentation file (which will be used to generate documentation page on heynote.com) by @heyman in https://github.com/heyman/heynote/pull/242\n- Add default redo cmd that works on all Platforms.
