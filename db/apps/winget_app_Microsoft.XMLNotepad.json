The original XML Notepad shipped in back in 1998, written by Murray Low in C++. Later on it fell behind in support for XML standards and, because we didn't have time to fix it, we pulled the downloader. But Murray apparently did such a nice job that MSDN was inundated with requests to put the notepad back up, so they asked for a replacement.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"2.9.0.15","site":"https://github.com/microsoft/XmlNotepad","source":"Microsoft Corporation","license_or_tos":"MIT License","resources":null,"verified":false}
