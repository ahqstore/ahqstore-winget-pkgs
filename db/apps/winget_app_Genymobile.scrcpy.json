Contrary to the default text injection method, it is not limited to ASCII and some other characters.This is functionally equivalent to the existing AOA mode (--keyboard=aoa), except it is not limited to USB (it also works wirelessly) and it works on Windows while mirroring (and without driver issues).The keyboard layout must be configured (once and for all) on the device to match that of the computer (that's the reason why it's not the default). To open the keyboard settings, several possibilities:- from the scrcpy window (when uhid or aoa is used), by pressing MOD+k (see shortcuts)\n- from the device, in Settings → System → Languages and input → Physical devices\n- from a terminal on the computer, by executing adb shell am start -a android.settings.HARD_KEYBOARD_SETTINGS\nFrom there, it is also possible to enable or disable the virtual keyboard.See #4473.UHID mouse\nSimilarly, it is possible to simulate a physical mouse:\n\nscrcpy --mouse=uhid\nscrcpy -M  # short version\n\nLike in AOA mode (--mouse=aoa), the computer mouse is \"captured\": the mouse pointer disappears from the computer and appears on the Android device instead.Special capture keys, either Alt or Super, toggle (disable or enable) the mouse capture. Use one of them to give the control of the mouse back to the computer.See #4473.Simulate tilt\nIt was already possible to simulate two symmetric fingers to pinch-to-zoom or rotate by using Ctrl+click-and-move:This new version introduce a variant to tilt by using Shift+click-and-move-up-or-down:Technically, scrcpy generates additional touch events from a \"virtual finger\" at a location inverted through the center of the screen. When pressing Ctrl the x and y coordinates are inverted. Using Shift only inverts x.See #4529 and documentation.Android 15\nA lot of refactors related to display occurred in Android, which required changes to continue working with the latest Android beta versions.See #4657.\n- Twitter: @scrcpy_app\n- Reddit: r/scrcpy","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"2.4","site":"https://github.com/Genymobile","source":"WinGet","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","app_page":"https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy","resources":null}
