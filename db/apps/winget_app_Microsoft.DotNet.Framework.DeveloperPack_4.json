There are separate installers for web and offline installation.\nIf you intend to redistribute either of these installers in the setup for your own product or application,\nwe recommend that you choose the web installer because it is smaller and typically downloads faster. You\ncan download the web installer here. Wherever possible, Microsoft recommends you use the Web Installer in\nlieu of the Offline Package for optimal efficiency and bandwidth requirements. The offline package can be\nused in situations where the web installer cannot be used due to lack of internet connectivity. This\npackage is larger than the web installer and does not include the language packs. You can download and\ninstall the language packs from here.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"4.8.1","site":"https://dotnet.microsoft.com/","source":"WinGet","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","app_page":"https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework","resources":null}
