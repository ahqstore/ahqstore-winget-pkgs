Node-graph based. Similar in functionalities to Adobe After Effects and Nuke by The Foundry.\n\n\nKnown Bugs\n- #504\nKnown issues\n- Rendering sometimes silently stalls after X frames. #248\n- Some image formats may have issues (PCX, PSB). #602\n- MTS video files are sometimes not read correctly. #186\nChanges (compared to 2.4.4)\n- Use Python 3 rather than Python 2 (which is not maintained anymore).\n  This will require very few changes to the Python code (mainly print statements), and most code can be easily adapted to be 2-3 compatible. #686\n- Use QtPy==1.11.2 rather than PySide.\n  QtPy is an abstraction layer for PyQt5/PyQt4/PySide2/PySide (newer versions support PyQt6/PySide6).  QtPy uses the Qt5 layout (where the QtGui module has been split into QtGui and QtWidgets).  Using QtPy guarantees a higher level of forward-compatibility with future versions of Natron, which may use Qt5 or Qt6.\n  PySide can still be imported explicitly, if required, but the resulting code will not be forward-compatible.\n  Note that 2.4.4 binaries include qtpy, but still import PySide by default. #687\nDetailed Changes\n- RB-2.5: use qtpy rather than pyside by @devernay in #687\n- RB-2.5: python3 support by @devernay in #686\n- Compatibilize with Qt5 in Gui by @YakoYakoYokuYoku in #699\n- Errata on QWindow header by @YakoYakoYokuYoku in #703\n- Initial GitHub workflow implementation by @YakoYakoYokuYoku in #700\n- Support for building with Shiboken2 in Engine by @YakoYakoYokuYoku in #697\n- Shiboken2 postmerge fixes in Engine by @YakoYakoYokuYoku in #704\n- Update bug and feature request templates by @Shrinks99 in #707\n- use a different (fake) enum namespace for shiboken & shiboken2 by @devernay in #713\n- Support for building with Shiboken2 in Gui by @YakoYakoYokuYoku in #698\n- Initial Qt5 sources for Gui by @YakoYakoYokuYoku in #716\n- Initial Qt5 sources for Engine by @YakoYakoYokuYoku in #715\n- Deprecate usage of qSort in ToolButton by @YakoYakoYokuYoku in #717\n- Set tab stop distance with tabStopDistance in Gui by @YakoYakoYokuYoku in #718\n- Substitute recursive mutex enum with QRecursiveMutex by @YakoYakoYokuYoku in #720\n- Invoke system in global PySide config by @YakoYakoYokuYoku in #721\n- Renovate usages of QLineF intersections by @YakoYakoYokuYoku in #719\n- Query screen geometry using static QGuiApplication methods by @YakoYakoYokuYoku in #722\n- Renovate QWheelEvent in Gui by @YakoYakoYokuYoku in #723\n- Index model children with QAbstractItemModel by @YakoYakoYokuYoku in #726\n- Use QMargins for table model view by @YakoYakoYokuYoku in #727\n- Use default QFlags construction instead of zero by @YakoYakoYokuYoku in #724\n- Renovate QString splits with newer enum in Gui by @YakoYakoYokuYoku in #725\n- Replace qrand with QRandomGenerator in tests by @YakoYakoYokuYoku in #730\n- Replace width with horizontal advance for font metrics by @YakoYakoYokuYoku in #729\n- Suppress Wnonnull for GCC 11 by @YakoYakoYokuYoku in #728\n- Allow node name reuse after delete by @devernay in #733\n- Insert to bimaps left instead of directly to avoid crashes in caching by @YakoYakoYokuYoku in #734\n- Save backup versions of projects by @devernay in #740\n- Remove ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md by @YakoYakoYokuYoku in #746\n- Only display the overlays for nodes that are in the viewer render path and have their properties panel maximized by @devernay in #745\n- Hide viewer buttons when roto/tracker properties panel is minimized by @devernay in #748\n- Fix issue forms for proper bug reporting by @YakoYakoYokuYoku in #750\n- Color selector palette by @rodlie in #754\n- Update CONTRIBUTORS.txt by @devernay in #753\n- Add AppImage build script by @TheAssassin in #739\n- Query site packages path using the Python site module by @YakoYakoYokuYoku in #760\n- Fix grammatical error in documentation by @kemonprogrammer in #758\n- Fixes spelling errors by @Shrinks99 in #761\n- Gui: added taskbar support by @rodlie in #766\n- Substitute QGL classes with QOpenGL by @YakoYakoYokuYoku in #764\n- Update intro.rst by @solecism in #774\n- qt 4.8.7 archive download page correction by @cgvirus in #787\n- PythonUtils: more portable version of dirExists() by @devernay in #792\n- Natron.rc: Use productName for FileDescription on Windows by @rodlie in #799\n- Document Qt5 build and install for Linux/BSD by @YakoYakoYokuYoku in #802\n- Copy node or group background and overlay color by @YakoYakoYokuYoku in #821\n- OpenGL rendering command line flag by @YakoYakoYokuYoku in #810\n- Shiboken generation in QMake for Python bindings by @YakoYakoYokuYoku in #803\n- Initial CMake build system implementation by @YakoYakoYokuYoku in #809\n- Fix freeze in Tracker when not in viewer path by @YakoYakoYokuYoku in #823\n- Implement offscreen rendering in Wayland in OSGLContext by @YakoYakoYokuYoku in #765\n- Gui/GuiPrivate: don't cast qint64 to Q_PID by @rodlie in #831\n- Partially revert Shiboken generation in QMake for Python bindings by @YakoYakoYokuYoku in #830\n- System libs for glog and Ceres in CMake by @YakoYakoYokuYoku in #829\n- fixes to build using cmake on macOS/Qt5 by @devernay in #834\n- Engine/CLArgs.cpp: allow dot in writer name by @rodlie in #840\nNew Contributors\n- @YakoYakoYokuYoku made their first contribution in #699\n- @TheAssassin made their first contribution in #739\n- @kemonprogrammer made their first contribution in #758\n- @solecism made their first contribution in #774","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"2.5.0","site":"https://natrongithub.github.io","source":"WinGet","license_or_tos":"GPL-2.0 Licence","app_page":"https://github.com/NatronGitHub/Natron","resources":null}
