It protects you from losing coins in a backup mistake or computer failure, because your wallet can be recovered from a secret phrase that you can write on paper or learn by heart.\nThere is no waiting time when you start the client, because it does not download the Bitcoin blockchain.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"4.5.5","site":"https://electrum.org/","source":"WinGet","license_or_tos":"MIT License","app_page":"https://electrum.org/","resources":null}
