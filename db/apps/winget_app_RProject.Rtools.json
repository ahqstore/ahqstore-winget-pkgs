Maintainers of affected CRAN and Bioconductor packages have been notified and provided with patches. Package authors may use pkg-config for establishing the linking commands, which should reduce the frequency of needed updates in packages.\nSome CRAN packages require to explicitly include <cstdint> with GCC 13. Package authors have been provided with patches. See Porting to GCC 13 for more information.\nUpstream MXE changes have been merged from a147a77503fc1933ba4196ad21025a99a0ba90b3., with additional updates as detailed below.\nThis release of Rtools also includes a version for 64-bit ARM (aarch64) machines, based on LLVM (and libc++). Compared to the version for 64-bit Intel, it includes llvm 17.0.6 (and lacks gcc, binutils). Currently it also lacks msmpi (not supported on aarch64), yasm (does not support aarch64), gtk2 and libv8. The LLVM flang (flang-new) Fortran compiler is still experimental and cannot compile some of the CRAN packages. A number of CRAN and Bioconductor packages will have to be updated to support LLVM (or aarch64), some package maintainers were provided with patches.\nThe Rtools cross-compilers run on Linux (tested/used on 64-bit Intel): one version targets 64-bit Intel Windows and one targets 64-bit ARM Windows.\nIn this Rtools release, these packages have been added:\nfluidsynth 2.3.4\nlerc 4.0.0\nlibdeflate 1.19\nlibidn 1.36\nlibpsl 0.21.5\nportaudio 190700_20210406\nThese packages have been updated:\nabseil-cpp 20230802.1 to 20240116.1\narmadillo 12.6.7 to 12.8.0\nbinutils 2.40 to 2.42\nbinutils-host 2.40 to 2.42\ncairo 1.16.0 to 1.18.0\nc-ares 1_25_0 to 1_26_0\ncmake-host 3.28.1 to 3.28.3\ncurl 8.5.0 to 8.6.0\nexpat 2.5.0 to 2.6.0\nffmpeg 4.2.8 to 4.2.9\ngcc 12.3.0 to 13.2.0\ngcc-host 12.3.0 to 13.2.0\ngdal 3.8.2 to 3.8.4\ngeos 3.11.2 to 3.12.1\ngettext 0.21.1 to 0.22.4\nglib 2.76.5 to 2.78.4\ngnutls 3.8.0 to 3.8.3\ngrpc 1.60.0 to 1.61.1\nicu4c 74.1 to 74.2\nimagemagick 7.1.1-25 to 7.1.1-28\njasper 4.1.1 to 4.2.0\njpeg 9e to 9f\nlibgit2 1.7.1 to 1.7.2\nlibgsf 1.14.51 to 1.14.52\nlibpng 1.6.40 to 1.6.42\nlibsodium 1.0.18 to 1.0.19\nlibuv 1.47.0 to 1.48.0\nlibvpx 1.13.1 to 1.14.0\nlibxml2 2.12.3 to 2.12.5\nlibzmq 959a133 to 3b26401\nmingw-w64 10.0.0 to 11.0.1\nopenssl 3.1.4 to 3.2.1\npango 1.51.0 to 1.51.2\npcre2 10.42 to 10.43\npixman 0.42.2 to 0.43.2\npoppler 23.09.0 to 24.02.0\npostgresql 13.13 to 13.14\nprotobuf 25.2 to 25.3\nre2 2023-11-01 to 2024-02-01\nsqlite 3440200 to 3450100\nxz 5.4.5 to 5.4.6","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"4.4.6104","site":"https://www.r-project.org/","source":"WinGet","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","app_page":"https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools43/rtools.html","resources":null}
