These attachments also have rendered previews in the message view.\n- Mailspring allows you to add Medium, GitHub and YouTube links to email signatures created in the app. (#2484) Thanks @sudeephazra!\n- Subject lines no longer overflow if they contain single long words (#2485) Thanks @probablykasper!\n- The Simplified Chinese translations have been improved - thanks @qiuzhiqian!\nDeveloper:\n- Mailspring now uses Electron 30, a recent supported release based on Chromium M124 - thanks to @Phylu for lots of PRs and manual testing that helped us move up three years of versions (v17 => v30) in the last 12 months!\n- The Changelog now mentions security contributions by Positive Technologies, Payatu, and Sonar in v1.13.3.\nNote: This release does not fix ongoing issues with Gmail OAuth - we are working through Google's revised certification process for continued access to the Gmail API and expect it to be complete in the next two weeks.
