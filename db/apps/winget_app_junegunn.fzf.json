If the default completion is not already set\n- 2. And if the current bash supports complete -D option\n- However, fuzzy completion for some commands can be \"dynamically\" disabled by the dynamic completion loader\n- See the comment in __fzf_default_completion function for more information\n- Comments are now allowed in $FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS and $FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS_FILE\n- Hyperlinks (OSC 8) are now supported in the preview window and in the main window\n- The default --ellipsis is now ·· instead of ...\n- [vim] A spec can have exit callback that is called with the exit status of fzf\n- This can be used to clean up temporary resources or restore the original state when fzf is closed without a selection\n- Fixed --tmux bottom when the status line is not at the bottom\n- Fixed extra scroll offset in multi-line mode (--read0 or --wrap)\n- Added fallback ps command for kill completion on Cygwin","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"0.55.0","site":"https://github.com/junegunn","source":"WinGet","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
