Papercut SMTP doesn't enforce any restrictions how you prepare your email, but it allows you to view the whole email-chilada: body, html, headers, attachment down right down to the naughty raw encoded bits. Papercut can be configured to run on startup and sit quietly (minimized in the tray) only providing a notification when a new message has arrived.\nNOTE: Uninstall any existing Papercut SMTP installations BEFORE installing this new version.\n- Upgraded to .NET 8\n- Upgraded to latest dependencies (Caliburn Micro, Autofac, MahApps) and associated systems to support .NET 8.\n- Switched to Velopack auto-upgradable installation system. Great project! (Thanks, caesay!)\n- Fix for log updating constantly causing unnecessary WebView2 loading. (PR thanks to arthurzaczek)\n- Fix for double request when clicking on links in emails. Issue #232.\n- Added InvokeProcess Rule (#274)","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"7.0.0","site":"https://changemakerstudios.us/","source":"PapercutSMTP","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
