Papercut SMTP doesn't enforce any restrictions how you prepare your email, but it allows you to view the whole email-chilada: body, html, headers, attachment down right down to the naughty raw encoded bits. Papercut can be configured to run on startup and sit quietly (minimized in the tray) only providing a notification when a new message has arrived.\nChanges/Fixes:\n- Upgraded to .NET Framework v4.8 (PR thanks to 1Jesper1)\n- Service doesn't overwrite settings on exit anymore.\n- Simplified HTTP binding setting for Service. Basically, \"http://0.0.0.0\" for \"all\" binding works again.\n- Added Attachment Icon (PR thanks to Cload)\n- Added graceful fall-back support and error message if WebView2 isn't properly installed.\n- Fix for checking registry key for installing edge webview2 & version fixes (PR thanks to 1Jesper1)\nThank you all for your feedback and assistance with this release!\nIf you have any problems running Papercut UI, make sure you have installed WebView2.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"1.0.723","site":"https://changemakerstudios.us/","source":"WinGet","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","app_page":"https://www.papercut-smtp.com/","resources":null}
