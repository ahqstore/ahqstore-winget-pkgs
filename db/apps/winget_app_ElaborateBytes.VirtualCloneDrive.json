Image files can be \"inserted\" into the virtual drive from your harddisk or from a network drive by just a double-click, and thus be used like a normal CD, DVD, or Blu-ray. Virtual CloneDrive supports up to 15 virtual drives at the same time - no matter if the image file contains audio, video or just simple data. Virtual CloneDrive is fully integrated in Windows Explorer context menus and on top of all it is free!\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"5.5.2.0","site":null,"source":"WinGet","license_or_tos":"Copyright 1999 - 2004 Elaborate Bytes AG, Switzerland.","app_page":"https://www.elby.ch/en/products/vcd.html","resources":null}
