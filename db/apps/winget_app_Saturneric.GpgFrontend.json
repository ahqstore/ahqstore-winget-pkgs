One of the excellent GUI Frontends for Modern GnuPG.\n\n\nWhat's New\nNew Application Icon\nI've introduced a sleek, modern design for the application icon.For Users\n- Added Qt5 Version of AppImage: Due to the unavailability of Qt6 on Ubuntu 20.04, I've introduced a Qt5 version of the AppImage to ensure the application remains accessible to users on this platform.\n- Fixed Local Time Display: The previously inaccurate local time display has been corrected.\n- Enhanced GnuPG Controller: The GnuPG Controller can now be opened without triggering a restart if no settings have been changed.\n- Resolved High CPU Usage: I have addressed the issue causing high CPU usage while using the File Tab.\n- Updated UI Icons: Menu buttons have been updated with more suitable icons.\n- Customizable UI Themes: Users can now switch between different themes, enhancing personalization.\n- Modular Updates: \"Version Checking\" and \"GnuPG Info Gathering\" have been modularized, allowing users to disable or delete these functions as desired.\n- New Module Controller: A new system for managing application modules has been implemented for greater control.\n- Improved Translations: Enhancements to German and Simplified Chinese translations have been made, with invitations open for further community contributions.\n- Language Settings Update: English is now available in the Language Settings. For more information, see Issue #135.\nFor Developers\n- New User Manual Repository: Access the updated manual at GpgFrontend Manual Repository.\n- Enhanced Module System: The module system has become more isolated and flexible, with plugins now loaded and activated at runtime.\n- Switch to Qt 6.5 LTS: I have upgraded to Qt 6.5 LTS to ensure longer support and enhanced stability.\n- Flatpak Platform Update: The Flatpak container runtime \"org.kde.Platform\" has been upgraded to branch 6.6.\nPlans & Considerations\n- Ongoing Improvements: I will continue to address discovered issues and enhance the user manual to improve the user experience.\n- Continued SDK Development: Development of the SDK and module system will proceed, enabling users to create their own modules.\n- Function Modularization: I aim to convert more functions into modules to boost the application's stability and customizability.\n- New Modules Under Consideration:\n    - Matrix Functions\n    - Email Functions\n    - Smart Card Functions\nNew Project Logo\nI am excited to unveil the new project logo!
