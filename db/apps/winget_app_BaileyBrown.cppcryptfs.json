It will not work with Dokany 1.x.\n\nThere is no installation program for cppcryptfs. Just save it somewhere (could be on your desktop) and run it from there.\n\nThe executables are signed by the developer and are for 32/64-bit Windows 7 and higher.\n\nThe 64-bit version (cppcryptfs.exe) requires 64-bit Windows. The 32-bit version (cppcryptfs32.exe) will run on either\n32 or 64-bit Windows, but it is recommended to use the 64-bit version of cppcryptfs on 64-bit Windows.\n\nYou can rename the 32-bit version to cppcryptfs.exe after downloading it if you wish.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"1.4.4.4","site":"https://github.com/bailey27","source":"Bailey Brown","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
