CLAN is designed specifically to analyze data transcribed in the CHAT format. This is the format used in the various segments of the TalkBank system.\n\n\nAfter installing a new version of CLAN for use with old data, you will need to get a new version of the MOR grammar by running the \"Get MOR Grammar\" option under the \"File\" menu. You should then run MOR, POST, and CHECK again on your old data to make sure they work with the newer format. Alternatively, you may wish continue using old versions of CLAN with old versions of corpora. CHILDES data on the web are continually updated to run with current versions of CLAN and MOR.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"8.12.00","site":"https://talkbank.org/","source":"WinGet","license_or_tos":"GNU General Public License","app_page":"https://dali.talkbank.org/clan/","resources":null}
