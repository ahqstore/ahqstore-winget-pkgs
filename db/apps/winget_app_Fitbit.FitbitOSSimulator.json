This allows developers to test their code without the need for a physical device, and to preview their work on a virtual watch face or app screen.\nRelease Notes - v0.9.4 - Mar 29th 2022: This version of the simulator replaces the old Fitbit SSL certificate and replaces it with a Google certificate.
