Enjoy more secure streaming, browsing, and work with NordVPN.\n\nNordVPN encrypts your internet traffic and hides your IP and physical location. Works on 6 devices at once, on every major platform. With NordVPN, encrypt your online activity to protect your private data from hackers or snoopy advertisers. Enjoy global connectivity along with high-performance speed and secure access to streaming websites, censored content and social networks.\n* New: You asked – we heard! You can now choose where your files land when using Meshnet's file transfer. Pick your preferred downloads folder for easier access.\n* Our NordLynx protocol, which powers Meshnet, just got a speed boost! For those curious about the magic – we switched it from WireGuard in Go to WireGuardNT.\n* Kill Switch will cut the traffic from your apps even when the VPN is just paused. Because \"paused\" sounds way too much like \"potential risk.\"\n* We've revamped the feature names and categories in Threat Protection Pro™, making it cleaner, simpler, and easier to navigate.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"7.29.4.0","site":"https://nordvpn.com/","source":"WinGet","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
