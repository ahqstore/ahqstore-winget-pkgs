It can also display two files at once, and highlight the differences between them. Unlike diff, it works well with large files (up to 4 GB).\n\nVBinDiff was inspired by the Compare Files function of the ProSel utilities by Glen Bredon, for the Apple II. When I couldn't find a similar utility for the PC, I wrote it myself.\n\nThe single-file mode was inspired by the LIST utility of 4DOS and friends. While less provides a good line-oriented display, it has no equivalent to LIST's hex display. (True, you can pipe the file through hexdump, but that's incredibly inefficient on multi-gigabyte files.)\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"3.0-beta.5","site":null,"source":"WinGet","license_or_tos":"GPLv2","app_page":"https://www.cjmweb.net/vbindiff/","resources":null}
