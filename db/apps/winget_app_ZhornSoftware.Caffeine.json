It works by simulating a keypress once every 59 seconds, so your machine thinks you're still working at the keyboard, so won't lock the screen or activate the screensaver.\nThe icon is shown above - it's the leftmost one in the task tray, and this is all you see. Double-clicking the icon empties the coffee pot (that's what the icon is) and temporarily disables the program. Double-clicking it again refills the pot, and will keep your machine awake.\nBy default the app starts enabled, and works every 59 seconds. There are some command line switches you can use to alter this behaviour.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"1.98","site":"https://www.zhornsoftware.co.uk","source":"WinGet","license_or_tos":"Free","resources":null,"verified":false}
