The underlying transmission can be implemented using QUIC, TCP, WebSocket, WebTransport. Use noise protocol to encrypt the transmission. Support NAT. Can be used in multi-layer combinations.\nIf there is no public network IP, you can use the node ID to connect. In some situations, directly specify the IP and communication protocol to connect.\nThe node private key is stored in .key files in the current directory, and the default file name is user.key. If it was deleted, a new node ID will be created automatically when the program is restarting.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"0.2.32","site":"https://blog.chenjia.info/","source":"WinGet","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
