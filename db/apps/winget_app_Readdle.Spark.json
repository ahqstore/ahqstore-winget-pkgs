Focused. Email.\n\nFast, cross-platform email designed to filter out the noise - so you can focus on what's important.\nHey everyone!\nThere’s more than meets the eye in today’s small, yet mighty update to Spark:\n\n- Improved mini-calendar with clearer highlighting of current day and easier selection of month and year\n- The \"Meet with...\" feature now displays available slots for the entire week, with an updated design for a more cohesive look.\n- The \"Meet with...\" feature is now available in both Day and Month calendar views, offering broader usability.\n- Adjusted logic for calculating free time slots within the \"Meet with...\" feature\n- Updated the user interface for pending invitations to provide clearer status visibility.\n- Events now show a slight shift in creation date on the day view, enhancing timeline accuracy.\n- Fixed an issue where switching focus to another event preview while creating a new event could not cause an error.\n\nThank you for choosing Spark! We value your feedback.
