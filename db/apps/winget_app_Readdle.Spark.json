Focused. Email.\n\nFast, cross-platform email designed to filter out the noise - so you can focus on what's important.\nHey everyone!\nThere’s more than meets the eye in today’s small, yet mighty update to Spark:\n\n- Added a new option that allows users to view all ‘Priority’ emails for better email management.\n- Adjusted the behavior of the composer when opened from the calendar, improving the user experience.\n- Updated the content of the warning message shown when users edit calendar events, making it clearer and more informative.\n- Fixed an issue where the calendar view would scroll to the center when opening event previews after midday.\n- Resolved a problem where the ‘Back to Home Screen’ button on the sidebar was unresponsive when navigating from the calendar.\n- Fixed the bug that prevented users from changing the custom recurrence options (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly) during event creation or editing.\n- Spark now correctly handles backlinks when no authorization process is running, improving reliability.\n- Corrected the display issue with shared calendar slots, ensuring they now appear accurately.\n- Fixed the issue where links to calls created in Amie were not being displayed in Spark.\n\nThank you for choosing Spark!
