Make gets its knowledge of how to build your program from a file called the makefile, which lists each of the non-source files and how to compute it from other files. When you write a program, you should write a makefile for it, so that it is possible to use Make to build and install the program.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"3.81","site":null,"source":"WinGet","license_or_tos":"GnuWin License","app_page":"http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm","resources":null}
