Future releases will be using ACS as well. ACS creates short-lived certificates for signature so the thumbprint is not fixed, however the certificate subject will always be the same.\nBug fixes\n- Fix portable builds not working if the TranslucentTB temporary directory didn't exist.\n- Fix erroneous \"Couldn't configure TAP to restore taskbar appearance once TranslucentTB dies.\" message in the log.\n- Make Start opened, Search opened and Task View opened states work on newer builds of Windows 11.\n- Fix crashes with GlazeWM and the Magnifier app.\n- Increase the timeout for the XAML TAP to hopefully reduce the amount of \"The wait operation timed out\" and \"Element not found\" messages being seen.\nVarious improvements/changes\n- Support for Ukrainian locale.\n- Improvements to German and Chinese translations.\n- This releases uses a new GUID for the tray icon, because the ACS certificate subject is different than the previous certificate. Due to this, your preferences related to the tray icon will be reset.\n- Remove the ttb: protocol, as it was an experiment for something that didn't end up working.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"2024.1.0.0","site":"https://github.com/sylveon","source":"WinGet","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0","app_page":"https://github.com/TranslucentTB/TranslucentTB","resources":null}
