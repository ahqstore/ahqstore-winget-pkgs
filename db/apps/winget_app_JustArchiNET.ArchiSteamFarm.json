This shouldn't be of any interest for vast majority if not every plugin developer out there, however, if by any chance you've previously assumed implementation detail of how ASF generates session IDs, then you need to review that assumption, as session IDs generated by ASF are no longer derived from steam IDs (@JustArchi \n\nSupport\nASF is available for free, this release was made possible thanks to the people that decided to support the project. If you're grateful for what we're doing, please consider a donation. Developing ASF requires massive amount of time and knowledge, especially when it comes to Steam (and its problems).
