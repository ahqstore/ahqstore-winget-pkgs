This is available through Subtitles > Speech to Text menu item or button: .\n- Our builds include a basic model that has decent speed and accuracy but not a big size. (You can think of the model as the brain.)\n- You can download a bigger and better better brain (model) in ggml format and configure it in the Speech to Text dialog, but it will be slower.\n- The dialog creates two jobs that appear in the Jobs panel: one to export audio and another to convert to text.\n- The results are added to the Subtitles panel as a new top-level Subtitle Track.\n- Currently, the only GPU our build supports is Apple Silicon. Otherwise, it is heavily multi-threaded on the CPU.\n- Known quirk: subtitle items sometimes start earlier than expected. Timing is provided by the model and tool, and we lack the skills and resources to improve this.\n- Expect there to be occasional errors. Like humans and non-ideal conditions, it is not perfect. We will not take action on bug reports about some piece of audio not converting to the expected text.\n- OpenAI has made some warnings about the usage of their Whisper models:\nIn particular, we caution against using Whisper models to transcribe recordings of individuals taken without their consent.... We recommend against use in high-risk domains like decision-making contexts, where flaws in accuracy can lead to pronounced flaws in outcomes.\nTransition Improvements\n- Ripple Delete a transition restores the entirety of the clips included in the transition.\n- Lift (non-ripple delete) a transition no longer leaves a gap; the gap is filled with the adjacent clips.\n- Moving an adjacent clip away increases the transition duration instead of detaching and leaving a gap.\nOther Improvements\n- Removed the Export > Video > Resample button. Now, there are simply ignorable inline warnings when making certain changes.\n- Added File > Show Project in Folder to menu.\n- Added a decimals <number> option to numeric keywords in the GPS Text video filter.\n- Changed Recent Projects to Projects: items in this view no longer disappear as Recent reaches its maximum length and old items are removed.\n- Added a Remove action to the context menu in Projects.\n- Hide the Reframe video filter and button if GPU Effects is on.\n- Upgraded FFmpeg to version 7.1.\nFixes\n- Fixed a crash doing when doing more than one Playlist > menu > Add Selected to Slideshow. In theory, this could fix other random crashes in Timeline.\n- Fixed a crash opening a project containing a subtitle track with no items.\n- Fixed odd value for computed width in Reframe output video filter causes export to fail.\n- Fixed Reframe visual control can create odd-valued dimensions.\n- Fixed AVCHD video frame rate is double (could fix other formats).\n- Fixed making a proxy video for a iPhone 16 Pro video containing spatial audio.\n- Fixed GPU filters paste below non-GPU filters.\n- Fixed Slideshow Generator dialog is too tall with vertical video mode.\n- Fixed GPS Offset would reset in GPS Text video filter.\n- Fixed the maximum allowed Time in the Time Remap filter to prevent white frames.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"24.10.29","site":"https://meltytech.com/","source":"Meltytech","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
