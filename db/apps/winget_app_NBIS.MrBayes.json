MrBayes uses Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to estimate the posterior distribution of model parameters.\nNews:\n- Added lognormal and flat ordered dirichelet distributions as alternatives to the gamma prior on site variation across sites.\n- Added new, optional moves for the fossilized birth-death model.\n- Added new, optional parsimony-guided moves for non-clock trees.\n- Support for Beagle 3 added.\n- Added support for FMA and AVX instructions in built-in likelihood calculators for 4by4 nucleotide models.\n- Added basic command line option support on Unix systems (-h,-i,-v)\n- Various minor bug fixes.\n\nNote March 20: Windows binaries are provisional (without beagle).","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"3.2.7","site":"https://nbis.se/","source":"WinGet","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
