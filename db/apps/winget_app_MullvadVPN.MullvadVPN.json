It can be enabled in \"WireGuard settings\".\n  This will also be used automatically when connecting fails with other methods.\n- Add feature indicators to the main view along with redesigning the connection details.\n- Add \"Smart Routing\" feature which simplifies connecting to DAITA-enabled relays.\n\nChanged\n- Never use OpenVPN as a fallback protocol when any of the following features is enabled:\n  multihop, quantum-resistant tunnels, or DAITA.\n- Improved output format of mullvad status command, which now also prints feature indicators.\n- Move DAITA and multihop to the root settings view along with moving multihop into a dedicated view with more information.\nmacOS\n- Disable split tunnel interface when disconnected.\n  This prevents traffic from being sent through the daemon when the VPN is disconnected.\n- Enable IPv6 by default. This fixes DNS and routing being broken on some systems.\n- Proxy DNS queries through a local resolver.\n\nFixed\nLinux\n- Set tunnel name to `wg0-mullvad` for userspace WireGuard.\nmacOS\n- Exclude programs when executed using a relative path from a shell.\n- Reduce packet loss when using split tunneling.\n- Don't block fragmented packets in the PF firewall.\n  Fixes various issues relating to connecting (and general instability) when IP fragmentation is present.\n- Fix Apple services not working by forcing stray connections out through the VPN tunnel.\n  This fix only applies to Wireguard, OpenVPN is still affected.\n- Disable DNS redirect when custom DNS is set to localhost.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"2024.6","site":"https://mullvad.net","source":"WinGet","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
