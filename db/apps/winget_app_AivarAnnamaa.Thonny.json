For Windows 7, 8 and for 32-bit Windows 10 use thonny-py38-4.1.6.exe which comes with 32-bit Python 3.8.\n\n### macOS\n\nthonny-4.1.6.pkg contains Universal2 build of Python 3.10 -- this means it is suitable for both Arm and Intel Macs.\n\n### Linux\n\nthonny-4.1.6.bash is a script, which downloads and installs thonny-4.1.6-x86_64.tar.gz (with Python 3.10) when run on x86_64 machines. On other platforms it tries to use system python3 (creates a virtual environment for Thonny and installs thonny and its dependencies there)\n\nPlease note, that version 4.1.5 was published only at PyPI and no binary builds were published for that version.\n\n##  Changes since 4.1.4\n\n- Make macOS installer work in Sequoia, #3283\n- Add more entitlements for macOS app bundle (may fix problems with programs using camera or microphone)\n- New and updated languages thanks to the translators at POEditor\n- Fix handling nulls in PyPI metadata (fixes installing some PyPI packages)\n- Work around dialogs getting stuck after minimizing windows, #3068\n- Fix too eager instrumentation of MicroPython code, #3043\n- Fix installing package from local file\n- Update several dependencies","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"4.1.6","site":"https://github.com/thonny/thonny","source":"WinGet","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
