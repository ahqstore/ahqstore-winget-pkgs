To validate the signature of this file, run the following commands:\n# Download the checksums file, certificate and signature\ncurl -LO https://github.com/getsops/sops/releases/download/v3.9.1/sops-v3.9.1.checksums.txt\ncurl -LO https://github.com/getsops/sops/releases/download/v3.9.1/sops-v3.9.1.checksums.pem\ncurl -LO https://github.com/getsops/sops/releases/download/v3.9.1/sops-v3.9.1.checksums.sig\n\n# Verify the checksums file\ncosign verify-blob sops-v3.9.1.checksums.txt \\\n  --certificate sops-v3.9.1.checksums.pem \\\n  --signature sops-v3.9.1.checksums.sig \\\n  --certificate-identity-regexp= \\\n  --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com\n\nVerify binary integrity\nTo verify the integrity of the downloaded binary, you can utilize the checksums file after having validated its signature:\n# Verify the binary using the checksums file\nsha256sum -c sops-v3.9.1.checksums.txt --ignore-missing\n\nVerify artifact provenance\nThe SLSA provenance of the binaries, packages, and SBOMs can be found within the artifacts associated with this release. It is presented through an in-toto link metadata file named sops-v3.9.1.intoto.jsonl. To verify the provenance of an artifact, you can utilize the slsa-verifier tool:\n# Download the metadata file\ncurl -LO  https://github.com/getsops/sops/releases/download/v3.9.1/sops-v3.9.1.intoto.jsonl\n\n# Verify the provenance of the artifact\nslsa-verifier verify-artifact <artifact> \\\n  --provenance-path sops-v3.9.1.intoto.jsonl \\\n  --source-uri github.com/getsops/sops \\\n  --source-tag v3.9.1\n\nContainer Images\nThe sops binaries are also available as container images, based on Debian (slim) and Alpine Linux. The Debian-based container images include any dependencies which may be required to make use of certain key services, such as GnuPG, AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, and Google Cloud KMS. The Alpine-based container images are smaller in size, but do not include these dependencies.These container images are available for the following architectures: linux/amd64 and linux/arm64.GitHub Container Registry\n- ghcr.io/getsops/sops:v3.9.1\n- ghcr.io/getsops/sops:v3.9.1-alpine\nQuay.io\n- quay.io/getsops/sops:v3.9.1\n- quay.io/getsops/sops:v3.9.1-alpine\nVerify container image signature\nThe container images are signed using Cosign with GitHub OIDC. To validate the signature of an image, run the following command:\ncosign verify ghcr.io/getsops/sops:v3.9.1 \\\n  --certificate-identity-regexp= \\\n  --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \\\n  -o text\n\nVerify container image provenance\nThe container images include SLSA provenance attestations.
