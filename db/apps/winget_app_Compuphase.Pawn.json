The Pawn compiler outputs P-code (or bytecode) that subsequently runs on an abstract machine. Execution speed, stability, simplicity and a small footprint were essential design criterions for both the language and the abstract machine.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"4.1.7152","site":"https://github.com/compuphase","source":"WinGet","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0 with Exception Clause","app_page":"https://github.com/compuphase/pawn","resources":null}
