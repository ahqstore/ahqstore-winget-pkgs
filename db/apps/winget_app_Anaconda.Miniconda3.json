Contains only conda and its dependencies.\n\nMiniconda is a free minimal installer for conda. It is a small bootstrap version of Anaconda that includes only conda, Python, the packages they both depend on, and a small number of other useful packages (like pip, zlib, and a few others). If you need more packages, use the conda install command to install from thousands of packages available by default in Anacondaâ€™s public repo, or from other channels, like conda-forge or bioconda.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"py312_24.9.2-0","site":"https://www.anaconda.com/","source":"WinGet","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
