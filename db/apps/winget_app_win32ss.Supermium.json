If there's a feature you want, which cannot be replicated by a Manifest v2/v3 extension, please ask!\nThe Chromium base was updated from 126.0.6478.249 to 126.0.6478.259 to reflect the ESR patches in that period. This may help with a few issues that were not tied to a Supermium-specific problem, such as random renderer crashes on Windows 7.\n\nOther changes are as follows:\n- (#760 and others) removed loader deadlock in memory partition area on Windows 7\n- (#915) added option to disable Crashpad, ``--disable-crashpad``\n- (#588) changing default behaviour for icon loading on download page due to excessive process creation and poorer variety of icons. Use ``--force-generic-download-icons`` to restore this functionality.\n- (#898) added double click to close tabs feature from Thorium, ``--double-click-close-tab``\n- (#946) crash when adding bookmarks while ``--no-sync`` in use, is fixed\n- (#916) PDF loading bug on Windows 7 fixed, with change in fallback font from Arial to Arial Unicode MS\n- (#937) Patcher introduced for Widevine CDM on Windows 7. It is located in the base Supermium directory and is named ``win7_fixwidevine.cmd``. It is based on the default user data location, users with a non-default user data directory will have to change it accordingly. Use each time a new Widevine release has been downloaded (there are no auto-updates for integrity reasons, so this should only need to be done sparingly).\n- (#912, #955) hashes are now available in SHA2-256 and SHA3-512 format for each file in the Releases directory\n- (#906) ``--history-journeys`` and ``--side-panel-journeys`` restored\n- (#871) Dark mode implementation fixed and duplicate options removed, replaced with unique options\n- (#899) Zip distribution added for XP users who may not be able to run the installer due to error 6 (OS issue if persistent)","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"126.0.6478.254 R4","site":"https://win32subsystem.live/","source":"win32ss","license_or_tos":"BSD-3-Clause","resources":null,"verified":false}
