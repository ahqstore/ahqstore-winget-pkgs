See > zen-browser/desktop#1216 Thanks to the author for talking to me on Reddit and then accepting my pull request.\n- Disabled \"Normandy\", a component that allows Mozilla to alter extension configurations at will remotely. (bleh wtf is that)\n- Enabled JS_SHELL, for devs looking to use extensions like https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/scratchpad/ to get a semblance of that functionality that they removed.\n- Tabstrip functionality of Firefox View is enabled, without actually enabling firefox view due to it's other bad stuff we don't want (You can still manually enable it in about:config, then re-add it to the tabstrip with the buttons editor).\n- MacOS builds lack PGO, since I had to cross-compile them. May reduce performance.\nNOTE: For those looking to build for themselves, cross compiling for MacOS is now broken since Apple complained about Mozilla redistributing the XCode SDK (of course ðŸ™„). The workaround involves a lengthy process to package up the SDK from a Mac, then copy it to your Linux machine. It's outside the scope of these release notes, but I may add instructions to the //docs folder at a later date.UI Update: Next release will have some UI patches from Floorp, a popular Firefox fork. However, remember that Mercury doesn't attempt to heavily modify the UI from upstream Firefox, so don't expect Mercury to end up being a compiler optimized Floorp. I promise there won't be a freakin months long delay in updating. But I also tend to put Thorium and Codium first over my other projects. One man can only do so much, even with as often as I am on the computer doing nerd stuff.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"129.0.2","site":"https://github.com/Alex313031","source":"Alex313031","license_or_tos":"MPL-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
