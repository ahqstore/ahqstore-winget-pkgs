It offers the possibility to communicate directly to BDR Thermea Group boilers/appliances. The software shows temperatures, fan speed and the status of on/off components like pump and gas-air unit in a clear overview. In Recom, all parameters of the safety unit of the boiler are shown in one overview. Of course you can save settings on a hard drive, so you can always reset to default settings or use a certain setting for multiple boilers in a project.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"7.4.10.0","site":"https://www.bdrthermeagroup.com/","source":"WinGet","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
