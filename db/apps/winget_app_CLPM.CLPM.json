It can manage projects in both global and project specific contexts. It would be called a \"package manager\" in most other contexts, but the use of \"package\" unfortunately collides with the use of \"package\" in the Common Lisp spec as a namespace for symbols.\n\nIt consists of two major pieces. First is a standalone program that is responsible for all the heavy lifting of downloading and unpacking releases in the correct place, resolving dependencies, and managing project specific environments. This piece is generally referred to as CLPM, the CLPM core, or `clpm` and is distributed as a precompiled executable using SBCL (but it is possible to compile it from source). The second is a small client library written in portable Common Lisp that interfaces with ASDF and calls CLPM as necessary to find and install missing systems. This piece is generally referred to as the CLPM client or `clpm-client` and is meant to be loaded when you are interactively developing code.\n\nCLPM is licensed under the two clause BSD license (BSD-2). So, basically do what you want with it (while providing appropriate attribution) and don't complain if it breaks things. CLPM is currently beta quality so expect some breakage and incompatibilites going forward.\n\nTo receive help or report issues please send email to <mailto:clpm-devel@common-lisp.net>. Additionally, feel free to join the email list at <https://mailman.common-lisp.net/listinfo/clpm-devel>. To join in the development of CLPM, you can find the project hosted on the common-lisp.net Gitlab server at <https://gitlab.common-lisp.net/clpm/clpm>.\nBug fix release, install.sh fixed so that the `share/` folder (which includes the client) is fully installed.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"0.4.2-rc.2","site":"https://www.clpm.dev/","source":"WinGet","license_or_tos":"BSD-2-Clause","app_page":"https://www.clpm.dev/","resources":null}
