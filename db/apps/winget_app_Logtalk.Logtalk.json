Adapted from Prolog code written and contributed by Paul Tarau.\n- UPDATED: The assumptions example with another individual example.\nInstallers and installation scripts\nTests\n- ADDED: Additional tests for the left-recursion linter warning.\n- ADDED: Additional tests for the Prolog standard round/1 evaluable.\n- IMPROVED: The manual installation script and MacPorts Portfile instructions for defining the LOGTALKHOME and LOGTALKUSER environment variables.\nIDEs, text editors, and syntax highlighters support\n- UPDATED: VSCode support to use the new logtalk::message_prefix_file/6 hook predicate to support displaying warnings and errors augmented with the tutor tool explanations.\n- UPDATED: VSCode support to also list the lgtunit tool warning and error messages in the \"PROBLEMS\" pane.\n- FIXED: Compilation errors when loading the VSCode support file using the XSB backend.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"3.86.0","site":"https://logtalk.org/","source":"Logtalk.org","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
