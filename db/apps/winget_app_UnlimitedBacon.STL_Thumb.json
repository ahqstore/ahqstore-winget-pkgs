It can show previews for STL files in your file manager on Linux and Windows. It is written in Rust and uses OpenGL.\n\n\n- FXAA Anti-aliasing - Images look much nicer now without the jagged edges! FXAA is on by default, but can be shut off. It has minimal performance impact.\n- Pipes! - Can now read STL data from the stdin stream instead of a file\n- Faster Image Compression\n- Added option to force recalculating face normals if your STL files are malformed\n- Published on package on crates.io and docs on docs.rs.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"0.5.0","site":"https://github.com/unlimitedbacon/stl-thumb","source":"UnlimitedBacon","license_or_tos":"MIT License","resources":null,"verified":false}
