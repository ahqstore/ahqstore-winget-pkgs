The created zip archive is correct except for the useless zero bytes after the end of the archive. When unpacking such a zip archive, 7-Zip displays a warning: \"WARNING: There are data after the end of archive\".\n- The bug was fixed: there was a leak of GDI objects (internal resources in Windows) in \"Confirm File Replace\" window, causing problems after 1600 displays of \"Confirm File Replace\" window from same running 7-Zip process.\n- Some optimizations for displaying file icons in 7-Zip File Manager and in \"Confirm File Replace\" window.\n- Some bugs were fixed.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"24.08","site":"https://7-zip.org/","source":"WinGet","license_or_tos":"LGPL-2.1","app_page":"https://7-zip.org/","resources":null}
