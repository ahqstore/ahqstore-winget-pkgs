On start up, WinDirStat reads the whole directory tree once and then presents it in three useful views:\n- The directory list, which resembles the tree view of the Windows Explorer but is sorted by file/subtree size,\n- The treemap, which shows the whole contents of the directory tree straight away,\n- The extension list, which serves as a legend and shows statistics about the file types.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"1.1.2","site":"https://windirstat.net","source":"WinGet","license_or_tos":"GNU Public License, version 2 (GPLv2)","app_page":"https://windirstat.net","resources":null}
