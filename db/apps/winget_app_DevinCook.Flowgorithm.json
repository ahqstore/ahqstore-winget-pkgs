Many languages\nrequire students to write lines of confusing code just to display the text \"Hello, world!\". This is normal for most\nobject-oriented languages, but beginner students are far from learning these concepts.\n\nBy using flowcharts, you can concentrate on programming concepts rather than all the nuances of a typical programming\nlanguage. Programs can be executed directly in Flowgorithm.\n\nOnce you understand programming logic, it is easy for you to learn one of the major languages. Flowgorithm can\ninteractively convert your flowchart to over 18 languages. These include: C#, C++, Java, JavaScript, Lua, Perl, Python,\nRuby, Swift, Visual Basic .NET, and VBA (used in Office).\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"4.2","site":null,"source":"Devin Cook","license_or_tos":"EULA","resources":null,"verified":false}
