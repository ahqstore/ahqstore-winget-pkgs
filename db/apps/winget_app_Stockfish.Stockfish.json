SlowMover has also been removed in favor of Move Overhead.\nMore binaries:\nWe now offer 13 new binaries. These new binaries include avx512, vnni256, vnni512, m1-apple-silicon, and armv8-dotprod, which take advantage of specific CPU instructions for improved performance.\nFor most users, using sse41-popcnt (formerly modern), avx2, or bmi2 should be enough, but if your CPU supports these new instructions, feel free to try them!\nDevelopment changes:\n- Updated testing book: This new book, now derived exclusively from the open Lichess database, is 10 times larger than its predecessor, and has been used to test potential improvements to Stockfish over the past few months.\n- Consolidation of repositories: Aiming to simplify access to our resources, we have moved most Stockfish-related repositories into the official Stockfish organization on GitHub.\n- Growing maintainer team: We welcome Disservin to the team of maintainers of the project! This extra pair of hands will ensure the lasting success of Stockfish.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"16.1","site":"https://stockfishchess.org/","source":"WinGet","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
