This means that kinetic (momentum) scrolling can now be interrupted by placing two fingers on the touchpad.\n- HEVC hardware support is implemented for Windows users.\nFixed\n- Fixed an issue that started with macOS Sonoma where the emoji picker would open and immediately close when opened with the Cmd+Ctrl+Space shortcut.\n  Thanks to research by Carlos Duarte do Nascimento (Chester) and :bintoro, and a patch by Carlos Duarte do Nascimento (Chester), we have been able to fix this universally for this shortcut and similar shortcuts going forward.\n- Fixed an issue that started with macOS Sonoma where the emoji picker would also insert the character \"e\" in the selected text field/box when opening the emoji picker using the Fn+e shortcut.\n  We have also fixed this for similar shortcuts using the Fn key.\nChanged\n- Firefox follows now the model HTML specification for transient user activation more closely. This change makes popup blocking less strict in cases where previous versions of Firefox were overly aggressive, reducing erroneous blocking prompts.\nDeveloper","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"134.0","site":"https://www.mozilla.org/","source":"Mozilla","license_or_tos":"MPL-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
