NetBird creates a WireGuard-based overlay network that automatically connects your machines over an encrypted tunnel, leaving behind the hassle of opening ports, complex firewall rules, VPN gateways, and so forth.\nSecure. NetBird enables secure remote access by applying granular access policies while allowing you to manage them intuitively from a single place. Works universally on any infrastructure.\nRelease notes\nWith this release, we are introducing a new concept in NetBird called Networks. This concept improves the administration of routed resources and provides greater visibility into what is shared with peers. Networks are configuration containers that map your on-premise or cloud networks in a logical set of configurations, making it easier to manage and share routes with your peers based on your infrastructure.\nSupport for Networks will be available for our cloud-hosted systems in the next few days.\nYou can find out more information about Networks here: Concept Routing traffic to multiple IP resources Accessing restricted website domain resources Accessing entire domains within networks\nSome screenshots: Unified view of your network resources:\nMultiple resource types and new support for wildcard domains:\nWhat's Changed\n- [client] Add support for state manager on iOS by @pascal-fischer in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/2996\n- [client] Add peer conn init limit by @mlsmaycon in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/3001\n- [management] Remove peer needs login log message by @bcmmbaga in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/3005\n- [management] restructure api files by @pascal-fischer in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/3013\n- [Snyk] Security upgrade alpine from 3.20 to 3.21.0 by @mlsmaycon in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/3019\n- [client] Fix race condition with systray ready by @mohamed-essam in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/2993\n- [misc] split tests with management and rest by @mlsmaycon in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/3051\n- [misc] Handle dnf version 5 in install script by @mohamed-essam in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/3026\n- [client] fix: reformat IPv6 ICE addresses when hole punching by @jclds139 in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/3050\n- [misc] Upgrade x/crypto package by @mlsmaycon in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/3055\n- fix client unsupported h2 protocol when only 443 activated by @V-E-O in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/3009\n- [client] Avoid using iota on mixed const block by @mlsmaycon in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/3057\n- [client, management] Add new network concept by @lixmal in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/3047\n- [client] Do not start DNS forwarder on client side by @pappz in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/3094\n- [management] Fix duplicate resource routes when routing peer is part of the source group by @bcmmbaga in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/3095\n- [client] Reduce DNS handler chain lock contention by @lixmal in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/3099\n- [management] Run test sequential by @pascal-fischer in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/3101\n- [client] Add firewall rules to the debug bundle by @lixmal in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/3089\n- [client] Add stateful userspace firewall and remove egress filters by @lixmal in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/3093\nNew Contributors\n- @jclds139 made their first contribution in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/3050\n- @V-E-O made their first contribution in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/3009\nFull Changelog: https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/compare/v0.34.1...v0.35.0","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"0.35.0","site":"https://netbird.io/","source":"Wiretrustee UG (haftungsbeschreankt)","license_or_tos":"BSD-3-Clause","resources":null,"verified":false}
