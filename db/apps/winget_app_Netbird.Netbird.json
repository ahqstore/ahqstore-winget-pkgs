NetBird creates a WireGuard-based overlay network that automatically connects your machines over an encrypted tunnel, leaving behind the hassle of opening ports, complex firewall rules, VPN gateways, and so forth.\nSecure. NetBird enables secure remote access by applying granular access policies while allowing you to manage them intuitively from a single place. Works universally on any infrastructure.\nWhat's Changed\n- [relay] Refactor initial Relay connection by @pappz in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/2800\n- [misc] Renew slack link by @mlsmaycon in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/2938\n- Import time package by @mlsmaycon in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/2940\n- [client] Don't return error in userspace mode without firewall when setting legacy by @lixmal in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/2924\n- [client] Test nftables for incompatible iptables rules by @lixmal in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/2948\n- [client] Set up sysctl and routing table name only if routing rules are available by @lixmal in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/2933\n- [client] Allow routing to fallback to exclusion routes if rules are not supported by @lixmal in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/2909\n- [management] Refactor posture check to use store methods by @bcmmbaga in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/2874\n- [management] Refactor policy to use store methods by @bcmmbaga in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/2878\n- [management] Refactor DNS settings to use store methods by @bcmmbaga in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/2883\n- [management] Refactor nameserver groups to use store methods by @bcmmbaga in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/2888\n- [client] Code cleaning in net pkg by @pappz in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/2932\n- [management] refactor to use account object instead of separate db calls for peer update by @pascal-fischer in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/2957\n- [management] Add performance test for login and sync calls by @pascal-fischer in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/2960\n- [tests] Enable benchmark tests on github actions by @pascal-fischer in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/2961\n- Add guide when signing key is not found by @mlsmaycon in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/2942\n- [client] Account different policiy rules for routes firewall rules by @mlsmaycon in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/2939\n- Update Caddyfile and Docker Compose to support HTTP3 by @v1rusnl in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/2822\n- Unspecified address: default NetworkTypeUDP4+NetworkTypeUDP6 by @victorserbu2709 in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/2804\n- [client] Add pprof build tag by @pappz in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/2964\n- [client] Persist route selection by @lixmal in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/2810\n- [client] Add state file to debug bundle by @lixmal in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/2969\n- [client] Fix debug bundle state anonymization test by @lixmal in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/2976\n- [client] Pass IP instead of net to Rosenpass by @pappz in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/2975\n- [client] Get static system info once by @mlsmaycon in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/2965\n- [client] Add netbird.err and netbird.out to debug bundle by @lixmal in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/2971\n- Add missing parentheses on iphone hostname generation condition by @jnohlgard in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/2977\n- [client] Add network map to debug bundle by @lixmal in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/2966\n- [client] Don't choke on non-existent interface in route updates by @lixmal in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/2922\n- [client] Add state handling cmdline options by @lixmal in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/2821\n- [management] merge update account peers in sync call by @pascal-fischer in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/2978\nNew Contributors\n- @v1rusnl made their first contribution in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/2822\n- @victorserbu2709 made their first contribution in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/2804\n- @jnohlgard made their first contribution in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/2977\nFull Changelog: https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/compare/v0.33.0...v0.34.0","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"0.34.0","site":"https://netbird.io/","source":"Wiretrustee UG (haftungsbeschreankt)","license_or_tos":"BSD-3-Clause","resources":null,"verified":false}
