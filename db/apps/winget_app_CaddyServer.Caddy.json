Most changes are small, but some notable ones:- The templates middleware is now officially extensible (experimentally). This means modules can add custom functions/actions for templates to execute.\n- TLS storage cleaning is now synchronized across the cluster and remembered across restarts. This should greatly lower costs for expensive storage backends like DynamoDB.\n- Placeholders are now evaluated in config for certificate loaders.\n- Numerous bug fixes.\nThank you to everyone who contributed!Changelog\n- 65c489a0  Upgrade acmeserver to github.com/go-chi/chi/v5 (#5913)\n- ae5e2d96 caddyfile: Fix variadic placeholder false positive when token contains : (#5883)\n- db55da59 caddyhttp: Adjust scheme placeholder docs (#5910)\n- df5edf6b caddytls: Context to DecisionFunc (#5923)\n- 6d9a8337 caddytls: Sync distributed storage cleaning (#5940)\n- 11a082c0 cmd: Add newline character to version string in CLI output (#5895)\n- 979c413f cmd: upgrade: resolve symlink of the executable (#5891)\n- 64820706 core: Apply SO_REUSEPORT to UDP sockets (#5725)\n- 15adb893 core: quic listener will manage the underlying socket by itself (#5749)\n- 801ec756 fileserver: Add .m4v for browse template icon\n- b809ed71 go.mod: CVE-2023-45142 Update opentelemetry (#5908)\n- b4c7313c go.mod: Upgrade quic-go to v0.39.1\n- 36fce3fa go.mod: update quic-go version to v0.40.0 (#5922)\n- ec2de22a httpcaddyfile: Fix TLS automation policy merging with get_certificate (#5896)\n- f0ea489d httpcaddyfile: Remove port from logger names (#5881)\n- 87f63b12 httpredirectlistener: Only set read limit for when request is HTTP (#5917)\n- 16834d64 templates: Clarify include args docs, add .ClientIP (#5898)\n- 0259853a templates: Delete headers on httpError to reset to clean slate (#5905)\n- 2f7ceb57 templates: Offically make templates extensible (#5939)\n- 908e9569 tls: accept placeholders in string values of certificate loaders (#5963)\nFull Changelog:","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"2.7.6","site":"https://github.com/caddyserver","source":"WinGet","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","app_page":null,"resources":null}
