It makes cross-compiling simpler with binary builds of the standard library for common platforms. And it runs on all platforms Rust supports, including Windows.\nThis new Rustup release involves some minor bug fixes.\nThe headlines for this release are:\n1. Prebuilt Rustup binaries should be working on older macOS versions again.\n2. rustup-init will no longer fail when fish is installed but ~/.config/fish/conf.d hasn't been created.\n3. Regressions regarding symlinked RUSTUP_HOME/(toolchains|downloads|tmp) have been addressed.\nSince the release of 1.27.0, the project has welcomed a total of 7 new contributors. Many thanks for your hard work, and we hope to see you again!\nAdded\n- Added the logging of RUSTUP_UPDATE_ROOT and RUSTUP_DIST_(SERVER|ROOT) when RUSTUP_DEBUG is set pr#3722\nChanged\n- Ensured that CI builds target macOS 10.12+ on x64 and macOS 11.0+ on arm64 pr#3710\n- Fixed an error when writing to rcfiles by ensuring the creation of their parent dir(s) first pr#3712\n- Fixed unexpected errors when RUSTUP_HOME/(toolchains|downloads|tmp) is symlinked pr#3742 pr#3754\n- Fixed an unexpected error when removing a component by component name with explicit target triple pr#3601\n- Changed RUSTUP_WINDOWS_PATH_ADD_BIN to be false by default pr#3703\n- Fixed incorrect color state after ColorableTerminal::reset pr#3711\n- Replaced . with source in fish shell's source_string pr#3715\n- Fixed \"component add\" error message format pr#3724\n- Fixed file paths in CI-generated *.sha256 files on *nix pr#3730\n- Removed an unnecessary debug print pr#3734\n- Disabled the \"doc opening\" output on rustup doc --path pr#3748\n- Fixed the update of DisplayVersion in the Windows registry on rustup self update pr#3770\n- Bumped a lot of dependencies to their latest versions pr#renovate-bot\nThanks go to:\n- Anas (0x61nas)\n- cuiyourong (cuiyourong)\n- Dirkjan Ochtman (djc)\n- Eric Huss (ehuss)\n- eth3lbert (eth3lbert)\n- hev (heiher)\n- klensy (klensy)\n- Chih Wang (ongchi)\n- Adam (pie-flavor)\n- rami3l (rami3l)\n- Robert (rben01)\n- Robert Collins (rbtcollins)\n- Sun Bin (shandongbinzhou)\n- Samuel Moelius (smoelius)\n- vpochapuis (vpochapuis)\n- Renovate Bot (renovate)\nFull Changelog: https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/compare/1.27.0...1.27.1","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"1.27.1","site":"https://www.rust-lang.org/","source":"WinGet","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0 or MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
