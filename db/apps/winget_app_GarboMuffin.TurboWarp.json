That build was assigned version 1.12.2 even though no full release was made. Apple requires a new version number for each release, so I had to increase the number.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"1.12.3","site":"https://turbowarp.org/","source":"WinGet","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
