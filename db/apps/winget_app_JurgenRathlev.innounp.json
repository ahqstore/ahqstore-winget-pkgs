Inno Setup Unpacker is a console application to verify and get files out of the self-extracting executable.\nSince there have been no updates of the SourceForge project since 2020 and the source codes are not yet adapted to the current Delphi versions (Unicode strings are the native type since Delphi 2009), I have modified them so that they can be compiled with newer Delphi versions (tested with Delphi 10 Seattle). In addition, some errors have been fixed and new command line options (-l and -u) were added, as well as exit codes to support the use in batch files.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"1.75","site":"https://www.rathlev-home.de/index-e.html","source":"WinGet","license_or_tos":"MPL or LGPL-2.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
