Windows versions are also available, with some drawbacks. See Windows Issues for more information. A port on MacOS is also available.\nThrough the MLT framework Kdenlive integrates many effects for video and audio processing or creation. Furthermore, Kdenlive brings a powerful titling tool, a subtitling feature with AI-supported speech to text conversion, nested timelines (new in version 23.04), animation support through Glaxnimate integration (new in version 22.08) and thus can be used as a complete studio for video creation. Check out Whatâ€™s New for the most recent feature additions.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"24.08.3","site":"https://kde.org/","source":"KDE e.V.","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
