A tag is a metadata, i.e. data about data. A tag provides additional information related to the audio data itself: the author of the lyrics, the composer of the music, the name of the album from which the song was released, the release date, etc. These tags or metadata make it possible to exploit large music collections more pleasantly. The problem is that many audio files contain no metadata at all, while others contain erroneous, unnecessary or inconsistent informations. Sometimes even the file name does not contain any relevant information. It is difficult, under these conditions, to identify a song without having to play it. This is where Metatogger comes in. Metatogger allows you to correct or complete the tags of audio files.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"7.5.2.0","site":"https://www.luminescence-software.org/en/metatogger","source":"WinGet","license_or_tos":"freeware","app_page":"https://www.luminescence-software.org/en/metatogger/download","resources":null}
