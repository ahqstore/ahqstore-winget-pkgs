Just specify the name or ARN of the ALB in the http.alb field,and Copilot will figure out if it has an HTTP listener, an HTTPS listener, or both. Copilot will then create the appropriate listener rules and target group to send traffic to your Backend Service!)\n‚ù§Ô∏è Contributions Thank you, contributors ü•∞!\n- @trivikr (#5822, #5828, #5829)\n- @mathmul (#5831)\n- @ikorecky (#5825)","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"1.34.0","site":"https://github.com/aws","source":"Amazon Web Services","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
