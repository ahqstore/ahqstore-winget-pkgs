It supports the three major operating\nsystems (Linux, macOS, Windows) and a few smaller ones (FreeBSD, OpenBSD).\nChangelog for restic 0.17.2 (2024-10-27)\nThe following sections list the changes in restic 0.17.2 relevant to restic users. The changes are ordered by importance.Summary\n- Fix #4004: Support container-level SAS/SAT tokens for Azure backend\n- Fix #5047: Resolve potential error during concurrent cache cleanup\n- Fix #5050: Return error if tag fails to lock repository\n- Fix #5057: Exclude irregular files from backups\n- Fix #5063: Correctly backup extended metadata when using VSS on Windows\nDetails\n- Bugfix #4004: Support container-level SAS/SAT tokens for Azure backendRestic previously expected SAS/SAT tokens to be generated at the account level, which prevented tokens created at the container level from being used to initialize a repository. This caused an error when attempting to initialize a repository with container-level tokens.Restic now supports both account-level and container-level SAS/SAT tokens for initializing a repository.#4004 #5093\n- Bugfix #5047: Resolve potential error during concurrent cache cleanupWhen multiple restic processes ran concurrently, they could compete to remove obsolete snapshots from the local backend cache, sometimes leading to a \"no such file or directory\" error. Restic now suppresses this error to prevent issues during cache cleanup.#5047\n- Bugfix #5050: Return error if tag fails to lock repositorySince restic 0.17.0, the tag command did not return an error when it failed to open or lock the repository. This issue has now been fixed.#5050 #5056\n- Bugfix #5057: Exclude irregular files from backupsSince restic 0.17.1, files with the type irregular could mistakenly be included in snapshots, especially when backing up special file types on Windows that restic cannot process. This issue has now been fixed.Previously, this bug caused the check command to report errors like the following one:\n  tree 12345678[...]: node \"example.zip\" with invalid type \"irregular\"\n\nTo repair affected snapshots, upgrade to restic 0.17.2 and run:\nrestic repair snapshots --forget\n\nThis will remove the irregular files from the snapshots (creating a new snapshot ID for each of the affected snapshots).#5057 https://forum.restic.net/t/errors-found-by-check-1-invalid-type-irregular-2-ciphertext-verification-failed/8447/2\n- Bugfix #5063: Correctly backup extended metadata when using VSS on WindowsOn Windows, when creating a backup with the --use-fs-snapshot option, restic read extended metadata from the original filesystem path instead of from the snapshot. This could result in errors if files were removed during the backup process.This issue has now been resolved.#5063 #5097 #5099","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"0.17.2","site":"https://github.com/restic","source":"WinGet","license_or_tos":"BSD-2-Clause","resources":null,"verified":false}
