FreeCAD is aimed directly at mechanical engineering and product design but, being very generic, also fits in a wider range of uses around engineering, such as architecture, finite element analysis, 3D printing, and other tasks.\nFreeCAD features tools similar to CATIA, SolidWorks, Solid Edge or Revit, and therefore also falls into the category of CAD, PLM, CAx, CAE and BIM. It is a feature based parametric modeler with a modular software architecture making it possible to provide additional functionality without modifying the core system.\nAs with other CAD modelers it has many 2D components in order to sketch planar shapes or create production drawings. However, direct 2D drawing (like Inkscape or AutoCAD LT) is not the focus, neither are animation or mesh editing (like Blender, Maya, 3ds Max, or Cinema 4D). Nevertheless, thanks to its wide adaptability, FreeCAD is useful in a much broader area around its base feature set.\nFreeCAD makes heavy use of open-source libraries that exist in the field of scientific computing. Among them are Open Cascade Technology (OCCT), a powerful CAD kernel; Coin3D, a toolkit for 3D graphics development compatible with Open Inventor; Qt, the world-famous user interface framework; and Python, a modern scripting language. FreeCAD itself can also be used as a library by other programs.\nFreeCAD is also multi-platform, and currently runs on Linux/Unix, Windows, and macOS systems with the same look and functionality on all platforms.\nWelcome to FreeCAD 1.0!The most notable improvements over the 0.21 release series are:\n- the inclusion of the topological naming problem mitigation code,\n- an integrated assembly workbench,\n- a new materials system,\n- and many UI/UX improvements.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5oXSGhK7EY","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"1.0.0","site":"https://www.freecad.org/","source":"FreeCAD Team","license_or_tos":"LGPL-2.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
