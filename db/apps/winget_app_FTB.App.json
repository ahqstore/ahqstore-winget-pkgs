You can get it from the FTB website.\nðŸŽ‰ Added\n    CurseForge mods will now have a \"CurseForge\" badge in the mod details that will take you to the mod page on the CurseForge website #716\nðŸ”§ Changed\n    All authentication methods now use the ftb:// protocol instead of a local web server. This should improve the reliability of the authentication process\n    We now refresh your Minecraft Authentication token if it's within 6 hours of expiring to ensure you can continue to play your instances without interruption\n    Improved the wording around the \"Instance relocation system\" so it is clear that this is a relocation process and not a just a settings value #1077\n    Ram will now actually save if you change it via the input box #1024\n    Ram values now show the correct ram calculation. Thanks to @bryce-schultz\n    Hopefully fixed the app icon not working on linux machines #1098\n    Some modpack names breaking the file path due to trailing spaces #1099\n    Instances can now be relocated to basically anywhere instead of having safeguards around nested folders #1061 #1095\n    Java Licenses not linking to their respective Github Pages correctly\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"1.25.8","site":"https://www.feed-the-beast.com/","source":"Feed The Beast","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
