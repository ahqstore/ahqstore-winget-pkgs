For counting the lines of code, blank lines,\ncomment lines, and physical lines of source code in many programming languages.\n\nGoal is to be the fastest code counter possible, but also perform COCOMO calculation like\nsloccount, estimate code complexity similar to cyclomatic complexity calculators and produce\nunique lines of code or DRYness metrics. In short one tool to rule them all.\n\nAlso it has a very short name which is easy to type scc.\n\nIf you don't like sloc cloc and code feel free to use the name Succinct Code Counter.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"3.4.0","site":"https://github.com/boyter","source":"Ben Boyter","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
