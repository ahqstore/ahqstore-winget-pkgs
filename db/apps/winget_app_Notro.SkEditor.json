Happy birthday, SkEditor! We also hit 10 thousand downloads recently! 🎉Changes\n- @GliczDev and I have begun working on a built-in terminal. It’s still a work in progress, but you can try it out by pressing CTRL+Shift+`.\n- The installer was broken in previous versions and required users to run SkEditor as an administrator. If you're updating from v2.8.1, you might still encounter the same issue, but it should be fixed now.\n- Fixed the \"Close project\" functionality, which wasn’t working properly.\n- The \"Delete\" option in the project explorer is now more clearly worded to indicate that it deletes the file from the file system, and includes a confirmation screen.\n- Fixed an issue where buttons in dialog boxes weren’t being translated.\n- Adjusted margins across the app, so they should now be consistent.\n- All libraries have been upgraded. Thanks to Avalonia 11.2, the app should now start a bit faster!\n- Fixed an issue with the file icon in the project explorer not updating after renaming.\n🎉 Enjoy!\n\n📄 File Descriptions\n| File | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| 💻 SkEditorInstaller.msi | Quick, easy installation for Windows x64 (most common) |\n| 📦 Windows-x64.zip | Portable Windows version for x64 chips (likely your version) |\n| 📦 Windows-arm64.zip | Portable Windows for ARM64 (only for ARM devices) |\n| 🐧 Linux-x64.zip | Portable Linux x64 version |\n| 🍎 macOS-x64.zip | For macOS on x64 (Intel chips) |\n| 🍏 macOS-arm64.zip | For macOS on ARM64 |\n📝 Note: macOS installation requires extra steps.
