In a few days, I'm going on vacation, so the next version will appear in September - I hope it will be much bigger and finally important changes will see the light of day 😉Changes\n- Added a color picker to the \"Tools\" menu tab.\n- Improved the Escape button functionality in settings - when on a subpage, pressing it will return to the previous page; when on the main page, it will close the window.\n- Fixed incorrect icon size and title in the application \"introduction\" during first launch.\n- Removed the old API - Addon Rework added a new API, but the old one was kept and marked as deprecated - now it's gone completely.\n- Added variable name suggestions in the code completion prototype experiment.\n- Fixed a bug with the \"hex preview\" experiment that didn't highlight colors with a single #.\n- Multi-line comments added in Skript 2.9 will no longer be parsed by the code parser.\n- Removed the unnecessary \"Session saved\" debug log that appeared in the logs.\n🎉 Enjoy!\n\n📄 File Descriptions\n| File | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| 💻 SkEditorInstaller.msi | Quick, easy installation for Windows x64 (most common) |\n| 📦 Windows-x64.zip | Portable Windows version for x64 chips (likely your version) |\n| 📦 Windows-arm64.zip | Portable Windows for ARM64 (only for ARM devices) |\n| 🐧 Linux-x64.zip | Portable Linux x64 version |\n| 🍎 macOS-x64.zip | For macOS on x64 (Intel chips) |\n| 🍏 macOS-arm64.zip | For macOS on ARM64 |\n📝 Note: macOS installation requires extra steps.
