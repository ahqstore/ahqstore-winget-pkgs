All this without thinking or seeing\nall the in-depth details (once you’ve configured it right).\nSome fixes and features:\n\nFor all platforms:\n– Added option to execute a script after sending a Wake On LAN\n– Update on how the controls are positioned in the Settings window\n\nFor macOS/Windows:\n– Added the option to send a Wake On LAN to devices when your PC/Mac wakes up from sleep\n\nFor Windows/Linux:\n– Added the option to invert the icon in the system tray (previously existed for Linux already)\n\nFor Windows:\n– Setup now allows to install miniWOL on a portable device – no longer a separate installer needed\n  for using the application as a portable app.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"2.1.3","site":"https://www.tweaking4all.com/","source":"WinGet","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","app_page":"https://www.tweaking4all.com/network-internet/miniwol2/","resources":null}
