The notes are searchable, can be copied, tagged and modified either from the applications directly or from your own text editor. The notes are in Markdown format.\nNotes exported from Evernote can be imported into Joplin, including the formatted content (which is converted to Markdown), resources (images, attachments, etc.) and complete metadata (geolocation, updated time, created time, etc.). Plain Markdown files can also be imported.\nJoplin is \"offline first\", which means you always have all your data on your phone or computer. This ensures that your notes are always accessible, whether you have an internet connection or not.\nThe notes can be securely synchronised using end-to-end encryption with various cloud services including Nextcloud, Dropbox, OneDrive and Joplin Cloud.\nFull text search is available on all platforms to quickly find the information you need. The app can be customised using plugins and themes, and you can also easily create your own.\nThe application is available for Windows, Linux, macOS, Android and iOS. A Web Clipper, to save web pages and screenshots from your browser, is also available for Firefox and Chrome.\n- Fixed: Fix Markdown editor cursor is invisible on empty lines (#11316) (#11313 by @personalizedrefrigerator)","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"3.1.23","site":"https://joplinapp.org/","source":"Laurent Cozic","license_or_tos":"AGPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
