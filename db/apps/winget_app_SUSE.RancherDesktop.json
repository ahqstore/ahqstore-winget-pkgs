(#7331)\n- macOS and Linux only: Resolved an issue where the inability to manage .bashrc/.zshrc/etc., broke the ability to automatically start Rancher Desktop when the user logs in. (#7337)\nRelease notes for 1.15.0\nNotable Features & Changes\nKubernetes versions before 1.21.0 are no longer supported\nIf you are on an earlier version, updating to Rancher Desktop 1.15.0 will automatically update you to Kubernetes 1.21.14. If you must continue to use an older version, you should stay on Rancher Desktop 1.14.2.kuberlr and kubectl are native binaries for macOS on Apple Silicon\nRosetta is no longer needed for Rancher Desktop.New networking tunnel stack is now the only option on Windows\nIt is no longer possible to select the legacy networking mode.On macOS the socket_vmnet has replaced vde_vmnet\nIt is a complete superset of the old functionality, and the old setting is no longer available.Important Bug Fixes\nShell profile settings are not accidentally deleted\nWhen Rancher Desktop started either after a fresh install, or after a factory reset, and the computer was without internet access, then there was a race condition that could result in the deletion of shell profiles (.bash_profile, .zshrc, etc) (#7154).This race condition has been fixed. However, the code has been updated to always keep a backup file around, just in case there is another undiscovered way to trigger a similar bug.A memory leak on Windows has been fixed that could lead to a frozen system\nThis issue in the tray menu updater was diagnosed and fixed by @mikeseese (#7238). Thank you for your help!Port forwarding bug with older Kubernetes versions on Windows has been fixed.\nFor Kubernetes 1.25 versions older than 1.25.3, 1.24 versions older than 1.24.7, or any version before 1.23.13 the port forwarding to the host was not working (#5341). This has been fixed.Known Issues\nContainer Dashboard\nThe dashboard does not update automatically when container states have changed or new containers are introduced (#5775).Extensions Install - Allowed Images\nWhen using the Allowed Images feature and also specifying extensions in a deployment profile, the extension images must be included in both lists (#4920).Deprecations\nmacOS 11 Big Sur and earlier are no longer officially supported\nApple usually only provides security updates for the last 3 major macOS releases. GitHub removes CI runners once the OS is no longer supported. Due to availability of hardware resources and software dependencies, we may be unable to create new Rancher Desktop releases compatible with older macOS versions in the future.We will try not to break Rancher Desktop on older macOS versions as long as reasonably possible, but those versions should be considered unsupported.Updates to Bundled Utilities\n- docker 26.1.0 → 27.1.1\n- docker-buildx 0.14.1 → 0.16.2\n- docker-compose 2.27.1 → 2.29.1\n- docker-credential-ecr-login unchanged 0.8.0\n- helm 3.15.1 → 3.15.3\n- moby/buildkit unchanged 0.12.5\n- nerdctl unchanged 1.7.6\n- spin: new 2.5.1\n- spin-shim: 0.14.1 → 0.15.1\n- spinkube: unchanged 0.2.0\n- trivy 0.51.4 → 0.53.0\nConnect with the developers\n- The issue queue\n- Rancher Users Slack in the #rancher-desktop channel\nChangelog\nThe full version changelog, from v1.14.2, can be found using GitHub compare and the details of the release can be found in the v1.15.0 milestone.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"1.15.1","site":"https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/rancher-desktop","source":"WinGet","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","app_page":"https://rancherdesktop.io/","resources":null}
