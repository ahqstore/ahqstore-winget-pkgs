The \"S\" letter indicates SPICE. The purpose of the Qucs-S project is to use free SPICE circuit simulation kernels with the GUI based on Qt toolkit. It merges the power of SPICE and the simplicity of the Qucs GUI.\nNew features\n- Implemnted touchstone (S2P) files viewer tool #936\n- VC resistor made available for SPICE and ADMS-independent #959\nLibrary update\n- Added SPICE_Tline library containing transmission lines for Ngspice #896\nFull changelog\n- S-parameter viewer by @andresmmera in https://github.com/ra3xdh/qucs_s/pull/936\n- Update XyceDigital library and examples by @ra3xdh in https://github.com/ra3xdh/qucs_s/pull/947\n- Release/24.3.2 by @ra3xdh in https://github.com/ra3xdh/qucs_s/pull/955\n- Fix build issues by @ThomasZecha in https://github.com/ra3xdh/qucs_s/pull/957\n- Fix memory leak while simulator switch by @zergud in https://github.com/ra3xdh/qucs_s/pull/960\n- Fix Ngspice run in CLI mode by @ra3xdh in https://github.com/ra3xdh/qucs_s/pull/963\n- Fix disable simulation for XYCE by @ra3xdh in https://github.com/ra3xdh/qucs_s/pull/965\n- Fix simulation properties edition by @ra3xdh in https://github.com/ra3xdh/qucs_s/pull/969\n- Fix of BJTsub and Diode device by @ra3xdh in https://github.com/ra3xdh/qucs_s/pull/983\n- fix wrong selected bounding box for elliptic arc by @zergud in https://github.com/ra3xdh/qucs_s/pull/989\n- Fixed crash when no simulators found on first start by @ra3xdh in https://github.com/ra3xdh/qucs_s/pull/992\n- Spar viewer: Fixes and New Features by @andresmmera in https://github.com/ra3xdh/qucs_s/pull/991\n- Fix unnecessary setPen before draw_resize_handle by @zergud in https://github.com/ra3xdh/qucs_s/pull/990\n- Fix #997 by @ivandi69 in https://github.com/ra3xdh/qucs_s/pull/1005\n- Fix diode symbol setting by @ra3xdh in https://github.com/ra3xdh/qucs_s/pull/1006\n- Fix missing text in schematic after upgrading to Qt-6.8.0 by @ivandi69 in https://github.com/ra3xdh/qucs_s/pull/995\n- refactor: use QString() as empty QString constructor by @Integral-Tech in https://github.com/ra3xdh/qucs_s/pull/1003\n- Apply normalize_value to POT value by @ra3xdh in https://github.com/ra3xdh/qucs_s/pull/1014\n- Add SPICE entry for VCresitor by @ra3xdh in https://github.com/ra3xdh/qucs_s/pull/1016\n- S-parameter Viewer: More fixes by @andresmmera in https://github.com/ra3xdh/qucs_s/pull/1009\n- Apply path conversion only for saved schematic or schematic in projects by @ra3xdh in https://github.com/ra3xdh/qucs_s/pull/1018\n- Upload SPICE_TLine library by @ra3xdh in https://github.com/ra3xdh/qucs_s/pull/1019\n- Allow variables for diode parameters by @ra3xdh in https://github.com/ra3xdh/qucs_s/pull/1021\n- Schottly diode symbol fix and update library tree after creating new library by @ra3xdh in https://github.com/ra3xdh/qucs_s/pull/1027\n- Save the position / size of ExternSimDialog on exit. by @iwbnwif in https://github.com/ra3xdh/qucs_s/pull/1028\n- Update NEWS.md and VERSION before release by @ra3xdh in https://github.com/ra3xdh/qucs_s/pull/1032\n- Fixed context menu for tab diagram and ASCO execution error by @ra3xdh in https://github.com/ra3xdh/qucs_s/pull/1035\nNew Contributors\n- @Integral-Tech made their first contribution in https://github.com/ra3xdh/qucs_s/pull/1003\nFull Changelog: https://github.com/ra3xdh/qucs_s/compare/24.3.2...24.4.0","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"24.4.0","site":"https://github.com/ra3xdh","source":"WinGet","license_or_tos":"GPL-2.0 License","resources":null,"verified":false}
