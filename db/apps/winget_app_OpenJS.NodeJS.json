This API allows users to retrieve the stacktrace of the current execution.\n  Thanks to Rafael Gonzaga for making this work on #54380.\n\nDisable V8 Maglev\n  We have seen several crashes/unexpected JS behaviors with maglev on v22 (which ships V8 v12.4). The bugs lie in the codegen so it would be difficult for users to work around them or even figure out where the bugs are coming from. Some bugs are fixed in the upstream while some others probably remain.\n  As v22 will get stuck with V8 v12.4 as LTS, it will be increasingly difficult to backport patches for them even if the bugs are fixed. So disable it by default on v22 to reduce the churn and troubles for users.\n  Thanks to Joyee Cheung for making this work on #54384\n\nExposes X509_V_FLAG_PARTIAL_CHAIN to tls.createSecureContext\n  This releases introduces a new option to the API tls.createSecureContext. For now on users can use tls.createSecureContext({ allowPartialTrustChain: true }) to treat intermediate (non-self-signed) certificates in the trust CA certificate list as trusted.\n  Thanks to Anna Henningsen for making this work on #54790\n\nOther Notable Changes\n- [5c9599af5a] - src: create handle scope in FastInternalModuleStat (Joyee Cheung) #54384\n- [e2307d87e8] - (SEMVER-MINOR) stream: relocate the status checking code in the onwritecomplete (YoonSoo_Shin) #54032\n\nDeprecations\n- [8433032948] - repl: doc-deprecate instantiating node:repl classes without new (Aviv Keller) #54842\n- [8c4c85cf31] - zlib: deprecate instantiating classes without new (Yagiz Nizipli) #54708","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"22.9.0","site":"https://openjsf.org/","source":"WinGet","license_or_tos":"MIT","app_page":"https://nodejs.org/","resources":null}
