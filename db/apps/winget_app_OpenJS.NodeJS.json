This API provides comprehensive support for mocking Date and all major timers in Node.js, including setTimeout, setInterval, and setImmediate, both from the node:timers, node:timers/promises modules and global objects. After months of refinement, developers can now fully rely on MockTimers for testing time-based operations with confidence, ensuring better control over asynchronous behavior in their Node.js applications.\n  Contributed by Erick Wendel in #55398.\n\nJSON modules and import attributes are now stable\n  The two proposals reached stage 4 of the TC39 process, at the October 2024 meeting. The Node.js implementation already matches exactly the semantics required by the proposals.\n  Contributed by Nicolò Ribaudo by #55333.\n\nOther Notable Changes\n- [4ba31b7f20] - (SEMVER-MINOR) assert: make assertion_error use Myers diff algorithm (Giovanni Bucci) #54862\n- [dcbc5fbe65] - (SEMVER-MINOR) lib: add UV_UDP_REUSEPORT for udp (theanarkh) #55403\n- [ec867ac7ce] - (SEMVER-MINOR) net: add UV_TCP_REUSEPORT for tcp (theanarkh) #55408","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"23.1.0","site":"https://openjsf.org/","source":"WinGet","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
