Users can also choose to retain or modify Access Control Lists (ACLs) on sandboxed files, providing more flexibility in access management, though this may introduce compatibility issues in some cases. Importantly, this update addresses a security vulnerability documented under CVE-2024-49360.This release also includes the introduction of a user proxy mechanism, enabling user-specific operations, along with support for the Encrypting File System (EFS). By adding the configuration EnableEFS=y to sandbox settings, users can now utilize EFS within the sandbox environment. The new OpenWPADEndpoint=y option allows access to system proxy configuration, expanding sandbox functionality. Additionally, trace logging filtering has been enhanced, and by enabling LogMessageEvents in global settings, all Sandboxie events can now be logged directly to the Windows Event Log for better tracking and analysis.Technical improvements in this release include refinements to the startup processes for SandboxieCrypto, ensuring smoother operations. Applications launched via drag-and-drop now consistently use their parent folder as the working directory, improving user experience. Compatibility with Windows build 27749 has been validated to ensure a seamless experience for users. Additionally, crashes affecting Firefox Nightly have been resolved, ensuring better browser compatibility.We thank our contributors and users for their invaluable feedback and support. Update now to take advantage of the latest features, enhancements, and security improvements in Sandboxie Plus.For a full list of changes please review the change log.You can support the project through donations, any help will be greatly appreciated.\nIf you have issues with an update installation, just uninstall the previous version keeping the sandboxie.ini and reinstall the new build.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"5.70.3","site":"https://xanasoft.com/","source":"sandboxie-plus.com","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
