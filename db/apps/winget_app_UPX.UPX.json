UPX will typically reduce the file size of programs and DLLs by around 50%-70%, thus reducing disk space, network load times, download times and other distribution and storage costs.\nPrograms and libraries compressed by UPX are completely self-contained and run exactly as before, with no runtime or memory penalty for most of the supported formats.\nUPX supports a number of different executable formats, including Windows programs and DLLs, macOS apps and Linux executables.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"4.2.4","site":"https://upx.github.io/","source":"WinGet","license_or_tos":"GPL-2.0-or-later","app_page":"https://upx.github.io/","resources":null}
