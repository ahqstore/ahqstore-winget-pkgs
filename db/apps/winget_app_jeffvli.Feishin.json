I started this project over 2 years ago as a rewrite of Sonixd, and I'm quite proud of how far it has come. I taught myself web development by building Sonixd, and rebuilt it as Feishin with the intention of using all of my learnings from trial and error to build a more polished desktop audio experience. With the support of all the contributors, I can proudly say that this project has become one of the go-to music players for self-hosting enthusiasts.\nWith that said, I have a vision to bring an even better experience to the self-hosted audio landscape. Feishin is undergoing a full rewrite to audioling!\nFor the tl;dr of what this encompasses:\n- Electron -> Tauri\n- Performance and UX improvements based on my learnings from Feishin\n- First-class support for the OpenSubsonic standard\nYou can follow along with the progress by:\n- Joining the discord or matrix community servers\n- Dropping a follow or star on the audioling repository\nFeature and bugfix PRs will still be accepted for the time being!\nThanks, Jeff\nHighlights\n- Added Discord RPC art fetcher via last.fm (#817) (Thanks @jackmerrill)\n- (Jellyfin) Fixed compilation albums display on Artist page (Thanks @sel10ut)\n- (Subsonic) Fixed stream/coverart fetchers when username includes special characters (#817\n- Fixed app crashes in certain cases (#834)\nWhat's Changed\n- [fix]: package.json's devEngines property by @ari-party in https://github.com/jeffvli/feishin/pull/801\n- Fix artist page not showing \"Appears On\" section by @sel10ut in https://github.com/jeffvli/feishin/pull/812\n- feat: Discord Rich Presence album art via Last.fm (#341) by @jackmerrill in https://github.com/jeffvli/feishin/pull/817\n- README.md: Colorize YAML block, fix macOS capitalization and remove deprecated compose version by @C0rn3j in https://github.com/jeffvli/feishin/pull/847\nNew Contributors\n- @ari-party made their first contribution in https://github.com/jeffvli/feishin/pull/801\n- @jackmerrill made their first contribution in https://github.com/jeffvli/feishin/pull/817\n- @C0rn3j made their first contribution in https://github.com/jeffvli/feishin/pull/847\nFull Changelog: https://github.com/jeffvli/feishin/compare/v0.11.1...v0.12.0","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"0.12.0","site":"https://github.com/jeffvli","source":"jeffvli","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
