Further more it provides a incremental copy mechanism called Delorean Copy\n\n\n- Docu update on --anchor and --destination\n- --probefs failed on unknown filesystems\n- ln reports error code when it fails creating hardlinks\n- Introduced a static version of ln.exe for use under e.g. WinPE\n- Changed the behavior related to cirularties. No error message raised, but circularity are broken properly.\n- Multisource aka --destination in combination with --mirror did not work.\n- Symbolic Link creation required admin even in developer mode.\n- Directories can be specified as destination with normal file or symbolic linking.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"2.9.3.4","site":"https://schinagl.priv.at/","source":"WinGet","license_or_tos":"Freeware","app_page":"https://schinagl.priv.at/nt/ln/ln.html","resources":null}
