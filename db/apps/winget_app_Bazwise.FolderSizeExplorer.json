It can also calculate checksums (MD-5, SHA-1,\nSHA-256 and SHA-512) of all your files and can export Windows Explorer folder and file lists to csv files. Folder\nSize Explorer is a simple and fast disk space analyser that also provides almost all the functionality of the\nstandard Windows Explorer. It runs on both x86 and x64 versions of Windows 10, 8, 7, Vista, and all versions of\nWindows Server 2019, 2016, 2012, 2008.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"2.0.0","site":"https://www.folder-size-explorer.com/index.shtml","source":"Bazwise","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
