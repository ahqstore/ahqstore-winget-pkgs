Even then we will highly encourage digest pinning for security and reproducibility reasons.\nSee also:\n- https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#creating-a-cluster\n- https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#building-images\nNOTE: These node images support amd64 and arm64, both of our supported platforms. You must use the same platform as your host, for more context see #2718\nFixes\n- Updated kube-network-policies with a DNS fix for network policies\n- Fix conflict with developing kube-network-policies\n- Detect new docker ipv6 failure message and fallback to ipv4 only gracefully\n  - Fixes github codespaces, however we recommend ensuring ip6tables works on your host or at least disabling ipv6 in the docker daemon settings then: https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/27/#ipv6\n- Workaround podman no longer returning host IP for portmaps\n- Aggregate ipmasq sync errors in kindnetd\nContributors\nThank you to everyone who contributed to this release!\nUsers whose commits are in this release (alphabetically by user name)\n- @aojea\n- @AkihiroSuda\n- @BenTheElder\n- @CharlieTLe\n- @dependabot[bot]\n- @elieser1101\n- @k8s-ci-robot\n- @khanhtc1202\n- @kebe7jun\n- @neolit123\n- @network-charles\n- @richburroughs\n- @stmcginnis\n- @sword-jin\nThank you to everyone who contributed in any way.\nA special thank you to @neolit123 for all your help over the years, and stepping down when you no longer had the time.\nThank you!","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"0.25.0","site":"https://kubernetes.io/","source":"Kubernetes SIGs","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
