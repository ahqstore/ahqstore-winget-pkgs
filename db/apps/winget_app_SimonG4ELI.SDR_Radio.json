Took me 4 hours to find this 6 year-old bug!\nSilent Installation\n  * Fixed installer issues when using the silent (/S) switch. Had never tried a silent installation before.\nPluto\n  * Fixed bugs in the Pluto Temperature file as found by Sigi.\n  * TX channels disabled and powered down when starting the radio.\n  * I've extended the Pluto temperature file options so you can select the decimal separator if your locale-specific separator is not '.' . English and American users will not see a difference; German (Sigi) will.\nHelp\n  * Ribbon Bar, help - minor updates.\nELAD S3\n  * Fixed issues when downconverter not installed.\nPlayback\n  * Minor UI tweaks to the Playback window when Grid is selected.\n  * Made the Stop button in the Playback Selection window more obvious.\nUI\n  * Added a loudspeaker symbol in RX windows when the audio is not muted. If muted nothing is shown.\nOptimisation\n  * Probably not noticeable but makes me feel better ðŸ™‚ . I see a slight drop running 24 Broadcast FM channels and the Matrix display.\nAudio Recording\n  * Audio recording cache now only runs for the current (active) receiver, running on all was causing serious issues when many Broadcast-FM receivers were active. As part of hunting the above, I optimised the queue lists in the background threads (you'll not really notice much difference here).","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"3.3","site":"https://www.dit-dit-dit.com","source":"WinGet","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
