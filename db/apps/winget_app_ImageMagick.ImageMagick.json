It can be used to create, edit, compose, or convert bitmap images, and supports a wide range of file formats, including JPEG, PNG, GIF, TIFF, and Ultra HDR.\nImageMagick is widely used in industries such as web development, graphic design, and video editing, as well as in scientific research, medical imaging, and astronomy. Its versatile and customizable nature, along with its robust image processing capabilities, make it a popular choice for a wide range of image-related tasks.\nImageMagick includes a command-line interface for executing complex image processing tasks, as well as APIs for integrating its features into software applications. It is written in C and can be used on a variety of operating systems, including Linux, Windows, and macOS.\nMerged\n- .cut (Dr Halo) reading when run count in header #7734\n- Bump azure/trusted-signing-action from 0.4.0 to 0.5.0 #7725\n- Implement Magic Kernel Sharp 2013 and 2021 #7701\nCommits\n- beta release ddbed3d\n- update web site 0ca37b0\n- don't process TIFF image if there is an exception e96022d\n- correct download links 87f16e6\n- Closing blob before destroying it to fix access violation. 5d634e7\n- Also update the Q8 and Q16 version on winget after each release. dbbc963\n- support ICON size of 512 (https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues/7684) a404e92\n- Refactor code to prepare for reading tiled images with the new openexr api. a972fc2\n- Whitespace. 7a34b24\n- More whitespace. b31d8df\n- Code style changes. 8608c8b\n- Restored support for reading tiled images with the new openexr api. cbe12a5\n- do not \"ping\" image for identify:locate define (https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues/7693) 664c955\n- don't truncate \"clipboard\" delegate 39df846\n- Corrected check for indexed channels in PSD files. 7de80e7\n- increase the default undo cache limit b325b0c\n- export exception when undo resource limit exceeded 9e0a3aa\n- bump semantic versioning 7994540\n- corrected semantic versioning cd2cfea\n- Simplify checks. c108ef0\n- respect alpha Update trait (#https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues/7709) 2221bab\n- Lab translation not required for HDRI support (https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues/7724) a22cb78\n- Simplify setting the data_precision when writing a lossless jpeg image. 5fb1f0f\n- lastest autoconf/automake update c641095\n- if default font not found, identify a suitable font (https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues/7728) c10d6f8\n- eliminate g++ 14 exceptions ffc0b62\n- Fixed build error. f02dbd2\n- Removed statement to fix macos build error. a621033\n- reset memory to avoid possible uninitialized pixel 7d51cfd\n- search for default font (https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues/7728) a758e39\n- remove std namespace b3c11cd\n- clone website documentation a4d0fe1\n- conditionally compile new operator 01a5f46\n- configure urw type1 fonts 9a8db41\n- list font metrics 9efe144\n- check type1 folder for type1 fonts f56b105\n- search type1 folder for type1 fonts 6818700\n- eliminate compiler warning 6034f9d\n- Patch that ignores the layer and/or view of an exr channel name when all channels start with that prefix (#7751). 0b452bb\n- Don't write the null terminator in pdf values to fix the bug reported in #7756. 79bc772\n- exit on error exception 8492479\n- Removed font searches that were added for testing. f9bc211\n- Removed BORLANDC check. 5d3d7a7\n- eliminate redundant declarations 08de3ab\n- release ed93f7f","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"7.1.1.40","site":"https://imagemagick.org/","source":"ImageMagick Studio LLC","license_or_tos":"ImageMagick","resources":null,"verified":false}
