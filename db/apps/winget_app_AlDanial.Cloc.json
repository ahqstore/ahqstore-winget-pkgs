Given two versions of a code base, cloc can compute differences in blank, comment, and source lines.\nIt is written entirely in Perl with no dependencies outside the standard distribution of Perl v5.6 and higher (code from some external modules is embedded within cloc) and so is quite portable.\nNew Languages and File Types:\n- Arturo\n- Glimmer JavaScript\n- Glimmer TypeScript\n- Luau\n- Modelica\n- Mojo\n- Nickel\n- Pawn\n- Processing\n- Templ\n- Yang\nUpdates:\n- Support SQL output with --diff\n- Support counting in git repository directories not owned by the user.\n- Eliminate the need to write temporary files when using --fmt.\n- Restore Dockerfile CI by fixing CPAN module setup that somehow stopped installing Parallel::ForkManager.\n- Improve handling of C comments in Go strings.\nBug fixes:\n- Improve --fmt output column alignments.\n- Handle --no-match when combined with --fullpath and --vcs.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"2.02","site":"https://github.com/AlDanial","source":"WinGet","license_or_tos":"GPL-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
