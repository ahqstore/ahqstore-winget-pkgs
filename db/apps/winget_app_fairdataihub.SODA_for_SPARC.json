Moreover, requirements have been broken down into easy-to-perform steps and automation has been integrated to reduce users' effort to a bare minimum during each step, often to just a few clicks.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"11.0.0","site":"https://github.com/fairdataihub","source":"WinGet","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
