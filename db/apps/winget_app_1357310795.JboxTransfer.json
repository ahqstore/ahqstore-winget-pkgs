Due to the big difference in storage strategy, it is even difficult to migrate files from the old cloud drive (i.e. jBox), while the vendor could not provide an ideal solution. It would be extremely inconvenient for users to migrate files manually, which would greatly affect the reputation of Pan and may also increase the maintenance burden of jBox.\nTherefore, the JboxTransfer project was founded. We aim to build an efficient, secure and convenient application to automate and help users to better migrate files from jBox to Pan. Users can migrate files with one click after jAccount authorization without taking up local disk space or manually downloading and uploading files.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"1.0.1","site":"https://github.com/1357310795","source":"SJTU","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
