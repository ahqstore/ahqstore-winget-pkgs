The main highlight is a brand new graphical user interface, but there are a number of other significant new features as well.\n1. The new graphical user interface (GUI) makes it easy and intuitive to manage your Multipass virtual machine instances. This is what we call a minimal viable product and, as time goes on, we will be adding more functionality and tweaking the interface. You can launch the new GUI by looking for \"Multipass\" in the ways you normally launch applications on your host platform. Please try it out and share your feedback!\n   - GUI settings were removed from the CLI and moved to the new GUI: client.gui.autostart and client.gui.hotkey\n2. You can now add an external bridged network to an existing instance. Much like what multipass launch --bridged does, but for an already existing instance. In order to do this, you must:\n   - Set a default bridge via multipass set local.bridged-network.\n   - Set the instance to use the bridged network via multipass set local.<instance-name>.bridged=true.\n3. Instances can now be force-stopped using the new --force option: multipass stop --force <instance-name>.\n4. Snapshots are now available on the VirtualBox backend, which joins QEMU and Hyper-V in this regard.\nYou can find links to the Windows and macOS installers below. The snap package is available in the stable snap channel:\nsnap refresh multipass --stable\n# or\nsnap install multipass --stable\nMore highlights\n- Classic mounts are more secure now (#3323).\n- User and group ID mappings in mounts have been improved to prevent overlaps.\n- The snap package has been greatly optimised: it is now ~48% smaller in size (122MB -> 64MB).\n- The date and time inside an instance are no longer skewed when resuming from suspend (#982).\n- Along with the aforementioned GUI, the icon set has been updated, including light and dark mode icons on macOS.\n- We switched to vcpkg for building the gRPC and POCO library dependencies.\n- New Bash completions for get and set.\nYou can find a larger selection of changes since 1.13.1 in our v1.14.0 milestone and even more details in the commit log.\nFeedback\nPlease file issues on the Multipass GitHub for problems and feature requests, or join the Multipass Discourse forum to chat. You can also find us in the Multipass room on Matrix.
