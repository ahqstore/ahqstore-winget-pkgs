Geekbench AI measures your CPU, GPU, and NPU to determine whether your device is ready for today's and tomorrow's cutting-edge machine learning applications.\n- Upgrade to ARM ArmNN 24.08 on Android\n- Upgrade to Samsung ENN 3.1.8 on Android\n- Upgrade to ONNX Runtime 1.19 on Windows\n  - This change improves Half Precision workload scores on AMD and Intel CPUs.\n- Always extract native libraries on Android\n  - This change works around performance issues with QNN that occurred when downloading Geekbench AI from Google Play.\n- Update Quantized workload models\n  - The updated models improve Quantized workload performance and accuracy.\n- Use Core ML fast prediction hint on iOS 18, macOS 15\n- Fix Depth Estimation validation\n  - Previously, Depth Estimation used normalization ranges based on the current and previously validated images, making validation sensitive to the image order. Depth Estimation validation now uses a normalization range based only on the current image.\n- Parallelize validation calculations\n  - This change reduces the time required to validate workload output and the overall benchmark runtime.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"1.1.0","site":"https://www.primatelabs.com/","source":"WinGet","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","app_page":"https://www.geekbench.com/ai/","resources":null}
