Increase kMaxCallback.\" when playing multiple random audio sources rapidly (UUM-82788)\n- Editor Platform: [Linux] Crash on 'PPtr::operator RuntimeAnimatorController*() const' when saving a new animation file (UUM-79812)\n- Editor Platform: [Linux] Crash on MenuController::ExecuteMenuItem when selecting recent scene (UUM-82381)\n- Graphics Optimization Systems: Shader errors in DXC when building an empty URP project for Windows platform on a MacOS machine (UUM-78665)\n- Hybrid Renderer: [Linux] Crash on ScriptableBatchRenderer::GenerateBuiltInCBuffer when adding \"PerObjectData.ReflectionProbes\" (UUM-79332)\n- Input: Crash on InputDeviceIOCTL when closing Unity editor (UUM-10774)\n- ShaderGraph: Crash on \"0x00007FF9D3B9EE3F (nvwgf2umx) OpenAdapter10\" when entering Edit Mode of ShaderGraph asset (UUM-82663)\n- Vulkan: Editor crash when changing Vulkan Number of Swapchain Buffers (UUM-60016)\n6000.0.21f1 Release Notes\nFeatures\n- Editor: Added the Asset Manager for Unity packages into Package Manager > Services > Content Management section.\nChanges\n- Package Manager: Changed the color of selected icons to be more consistent with other elements in light mode.\nFixes\n- 2D: Fixed an issue with Render Graph 2D light look up resource usage. (UUM-79452)\n- Android: Fixed VideoPlayer test instabilities on some devices. (UUM-78032)\n- Animation: Fixed an issue where entry transitions were not reporting warnings when one of their parameters was deleted. (UUM-77622)\n- Editor: Added a more descriptive error message if FileUtil::ReplaceDirectory() fails to delete the destination directory.

(UUM-73430)\n- Editor: Fixed an issue that occurs when using dynamic color usage hints along with Text. (UUM-72341)\n- Editor: Fixed an issue where RPCore RenderGraphPerformanceTests are failing after additional error checking in ImportTexture. (UUM-81537)\n- Editor: Fixed an issue where the built-in \"Cycle Tool Modes\" shortcut would never enter the GameObject context. (UUM-79497)\n- Editor: Fixed an issue with splacescreens by using more specific keys for caching splash screens rather than clearing the splash screen cache on all changes.

(UUM-75542)\n- Universal RP: Enabled Native RenderPass option to follow Universal Renderer Data when rendering Game view. (UUM-73849)\n- URP: Fixed an issue to prevent repetitive error logs about C-buffer layout mispatch in GPU-instancing-enabled Speed Tree materials when enabling Rendering Layers. (UUM-64059)\n- VFX Graph: Fixed sticky note resizing could be broken.
