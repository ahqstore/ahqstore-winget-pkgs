If you have an animated SpeedTree in the shadergraph, be sure to connect an ObjectSpacePosition node to the input of the SpeedTree8Wind. If the wind node does not have an input on the ObjectSpacePosition port, the mesh will be shrunk down to a point at origin (making it seem to vanish).\n  https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/UUM-84616\n- Terrain: Trees do not render in 'Unity Terrain - URP Demo Scene' (UUM-84616)\n- Text: Editor hangs when rendering TMP Text Component with Left and Right Margins set in the Extra Settings (UUM-84379)\n- Vulkan: [Android] Particles not rendered in the Player on some Android devices with Android 14 (UUM-68080)\n6000.0.27f1 Release Notes\nFixes\n- 2D: Fixed light blending issues with shadows.
