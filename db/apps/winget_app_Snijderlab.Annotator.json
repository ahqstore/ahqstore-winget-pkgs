It can load MGF files (only in centroid mode, also do not forget to deconvolute if you have TD data). Once loaded you can select a scan and add you annotation while tweaking the exact settings for generating the annotation. The annotation itself is interactive to help you discover what the spectrum means. Which you can then export as nice images for use in other environments.\n- Major UI overhaul\n- Updated to rustyms v0.8.3, meaning, amongst others, support for ambiguous amino acids\n- Support for MaxQuant identified peptides files\n- Added colour annotations of the spectrum\n- Added option to show theoretical spectrum\n- Added detailed breakdown of score statistics based on ion type\n- Added tool to search for modifications (see the section tools)","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"0.2.2","site":"https://github.com/snijderlab","source":"WinGet","license_or_tos":"MIT","app_page":"https://github.com/snijderlab/annotator","resources":null}
