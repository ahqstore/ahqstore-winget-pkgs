See the two Notes above.\n  - Fixed playing music externally and then running your game could crash the game or result in broken audio\n  - Fixed getting a call or other system notification sound crashed your game\n  - Fixed the iPhone X home bar being visible all the time\n  - Fixed message dialogs to stop crashes when trying to show code errors on iOS 11+ because the OS has changed how message dialogs work\n  - Ignore GGS's \"Minimum Time to Display\" to fix black splash screen on startup if you had set this option greater than 0 in versions since we changed the splash screen method\n  - Deprecated the synchronous developer get_...() dialog functions, so they now do nothing in-game (avoids errors) - use the ..._async() versions instead\n- Ubuntu\n  - Fixed the name of the audio library the runner looks for on starting the game - fixes lack of audio for some users\n  - Fixed \"Error deleting sources + buffers\" error when trying to close games\n  - Fixed sounds popping when stopped if another sound is played directly afterwards\n- Android\n  - Fixed memory leak when using HTTP functionality and also a memory management issue which could have crashed the game if lots of HTTP traffic\n  - Deprecated the synchronous developer get_...() dialog functions, so they now do nothing in-game (avoids errors) - use the ..._async() versions instead\n- UWP\n  - Fixed the window size always being locked to a fixed size dictated by the UWP tools\n  - Fixed url_open() so it now works the same as Windows native\n- HTML5\n  - Fixed 0029360: HTML5: Audio doesn't play on iOS Safari, iOS Chrome or Android Chrome\n  - NOTE: Fix is for iOS and Android only - Windows Chrome betas currently exhibit this also, but Chrome are not yet committed to keeping the change on desktops\n  - NOTE: This change does mean initial loading times for HTML5 will now be longer while the audio files in your game are downloaded\n  - Fixed Mouse Pressed events not working on scaled canvases because the collision mask is offset\n  - Fixed mouse coordinates aren't scaled to match when your window or view is scaled\n  - Fixed functions to set the gain on an audio resource so they work as per native platforms\n  - Fixed high refresh rate monitors cause the game to run quicker than intended in Chrome and Firefox\n- Changed the default size of the GUI layer\n  - Changed the default GUI size for Draw GUI events to match the application_surface size so it is more consistent cross-platform\n  - Fixes various issues, such as text placement on some platforms (e.g., Mac)\n  - NOTE: If you use a Draw GUI event to scale your GUI and draw the application_surface, you might need to change your project to maintain your expected results:\n  - In your first object's Create/Game Start, you could do \"var pos = application_get_position(); display_set_gui_maximise(1, 1, pos[0], pos[1]);\"\n  - Depending on your project, you might find also that simply changing your Draw GUI event to be a Post Draw gives the intended result\n  - See the manual for more information\n- Fast Collisions Fixes\n  - Lots of fixes have been added for the Fast-Collisions system (if you enabled this for your project in GGS)\n  - Includes deactivating and reactivating instances doesn't refresh collision status, collision information persisting in the wrong room or after game_restart()\n  - Multiple fixes for Spine sprites and collisions, also ensuring that Animation Events fire correctly\n- New Audio System Fixes\n  - Lots of fixes for the new audio engine released with 1804\n  - Better support for stereo files being incorrectly used for positional audio\n  - Fixes for: volume levels and sync groups, audio distortion or lower quality output files than expected, whitespace \"hissing\" from very high bitrate ogg files, and more\n  - Fixes for the wrong sounds playing on audio_play_sound(), especially after using an emitter to play audio.\n- Misc\n  - Fixed sprite_add_from_surface() to now show a code error if the sprite has not already been duplicated (as is required), rather than crashing the game\n- Known Issues\n  - iOS and macOS Entitlements for IAPs and Game Center are not being set correctly in Xcode during builds, so you need to enable these manually when doing Create Exe\n  - For UWP YYC builds, you must have the old Windows SDK 10.0.10240.0 as well as our stated minimum, as Visual Studio 2015 expects Windows SDK 10.0.10240.0 to be installed\n  - Some audio devices can cause the runner to take longer than normal to initialise when running projects, so you might need to disable these temporarily\n  - Monitors with refresh rates higher than 60hz can cause timing issues on Windows, games run more slowly than expected on these devices\n  - Android NDK 17b above is not supported and neither is ARM64 package builds\n\nHeadline Bugs Fixed Since 1804\n- This release contains all in-game fixes in GMS2 2.1.5 (so there are a lot of fixes since 1804!) and this release also has:\n- 0016711 HTML5: Last used sound plays when changing tabs back to game\n- 0024834 Spine: Memory leak in skeleton_bone_state_get()\n- 0025418 Functions: Using Fast Collision system will cause incorrect results when using collision_line()\n- 0026336 UWP: Window resolution is always locked at 1200 x 900, regardless of what your room or view size is\n- 0027794 UWP: url_open() fails to open protocol applications, nothing happens\n- 0028089 HTML5: Safari won't play streaming MP3s until after the user interacts with the game\n- 0028839 Build Mac: Putty doesn't quote your password or escape the string so your password fails if it starts with a symbol\n- 0029055 Importing Projects: Unable to Import Project while project isn't saved and clicking 'No' on confirmation\n- 0029132 Audio: Sounds differ between the runner and IDE within the latest update\n- 0029261 Build iOS: Unable to create an executable as we look for xcuserdata rather than xc*data\n- 0029428 HTML5: path_endaction doesn't work\n- 0029632 Audio: Sync groups don't have any audio if you've set the position of a listener\n- 0029735 HTML5: keyboard_string doesn't repeat characters whilst key is held down\n- 0029761 Build Mac: No support for 64bit builds, which is now mandatory for Apple submission\n- 0029763 Audio: Crackling occurs if you set an emitter's velocity\n- 0029817 Audio: Clicking occurs if you change the pitch of an emitter\n- 0029774 Build Mac: Includes 32bit support in packages, which blocks AppStore submission uploads as of end of June 2018\n- 0029810 Mac: \"Allow resize window\" with \"Keep aspect ratio\" doesn't allow resizing window left/right, must be \"full scale\"\n- 0029816 Mac: get_open_filename() doesn't check the load whitelist correctly, stopping files outside the sandbox being read\n- 0029818 Build UWP: Debugger doesn't connect when debugging PC games, works fine for remote targets [issue was not in 1804]\n- 0029819 UWP: GML errors from your game are no longer shown, game silently closes [issue was not in 1804]\n- 0029853 Functions: Random seed is different if you restart your game after a room change has occurred\n- 0029857 Audio: 3D Audio falloff not working anymore\n- 0029873 GGS: Setting iPhoneX Landscape splash screen fails to actually apply the image\n- 0029884 General: Fast collisions have issues with collision masks that are very small such as a single pixel\n- 0029928 Build Android: Building with Lint enabled will always fail unless you have Bluetooth permissions enabled\n- 0029966 General: 502 website error dialogue on startup, often/usually accompanied by a broken tips feed\n- 0029970 Build Android: Access Violation if any part of your GGS package name is blank and you try to run/compile\n- 0029991 Debugger: Watches panel is defunct\n- 0029992 General: image_blend behaves differently in GMS1 to GMS2\n- 0029995 Font: font_add_sprite() is incorrectly offset in 1.4.9999, need to use font_add_sprite_ext() as workaround","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"1.4","site":"https://gamemaker.io/en","source":"WinGet","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","app_page":"https://gamemaker.io/en/gamemaker","resources":null}
