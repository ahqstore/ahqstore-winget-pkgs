Overlay provided by Rivatuner Statistics Server.\nNew features\n  - Updated PresentMon caputure service to v1.9.0, see PresentMon GitHub repository for more info.\n  - New metric: GPU Active Time (GPU Busy)\n  - GPU Active Time graph on Analysis tab. GPU Busy graph can be enabled via \"Additional graphs\".\n  - New overlay metrics: GPU Busy and GPU Busy Deviation. GPU Busy Deviation describes the deviation of GPU Active time from the frame time. The closer it is to 0% the more balanced the workload is.\n  - FPS <-> ms toggle on Analysis tab\n  - New real-time metrics: 1% and 0.2% Low Average\n  - More Powenetics v2 features\n  - PMD logs export (context menu)\n  - Mapping PMD data to frame time data points\n  - Smart data mapping via linear spline interpolation\n  - Real-time metrics reset button\n  - Updated AMD ADLX and Intel IGCL\n  - Optional ADL fallback (TBP Sim for RDNA2, Vega VRM temps etc.)\n  - Implementation network ping overlay entry\n  - Thread affinity controller (Intel hybrid architecture, AMD Ryzen with 2 CCDs)\n\nEnhancements\n  - Performance optimization AMD ADLX readings\n  - Reset thread affinity to default when starting a new game\n  - Overlay entry showing current thread affinity state\n  - Better handling of integrated graphics (UHD Graphics and Iris Xe Graphics )\n\nBugfixes\n  - Bugfix detection error (Call of Duty MW2)\n  - Config files access exceptions (Moved folder from MyDocuments to AppData/Roaming)\n  - GPU PCIE Rx and Tx throughput unit","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"1.7.2","site":"https://www.capframex.com/","source":"WinGet","license_or_tos":"MIT","app_page":"https://github.com/CXWorld/CapFrameX","resources":null}
