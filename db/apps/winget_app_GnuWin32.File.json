Unlike most GUI systems, command-line UNIX systems - with this program leading the charge - don't rely on filename extentions to tell you the type of a file, but look at the file's actual contents. This is, of course, more reliable, but requires a bit of I/O.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"5.03","site":"https://www.darwinsys.com/file/","source":"GnuWin32","license_or_tos":"GnuWin License","resources":null,"verified":false}
