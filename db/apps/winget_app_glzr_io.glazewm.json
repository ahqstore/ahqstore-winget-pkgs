This brings a few big improvements:\n- Instant transitions when switching between workspaces.\n- Better stability and compatibility with third-party apps (resolving issues like #250).\n- Consistency in which windows are shown in the taskbar.\nNote: With cloaking enabled, windows from all workspaces appear in the Windows taskbar. The new method should hopefully feel much nicer, but the legacy method remains available via general.hide_method set to hide.üéâ Other new features\n- New --hide-window flag for shell-exec to run commands in background (#819).\n    - Makes it possible to run scripts without any terminal popup windows.\n- Add new position --x-pos <POS> --y-pos <POS> command for repositioning floating windows (#817).\n    - e.g. position --x-pos 0 --y-pos 0.\n- Size and position can now be set with the set-floating command (#817)\n    - e.g. set-floating --x-pos 0 --y-pos 0 --width 500px --height 500px.\n- Smoother restore from maximize into tiling/floating position (#852).\nüêõ Bug fixes\n- Fix regression from v3.4.0 where some taskbar positions cause incorrect working area (#850, fixes #790).\n- Persist window animations setting across restarts (#832, fixes #651).\n- Prevent window flicker when toggling between fullscreen states (#851, fixes #640).\n- Set focus to valid desktop window in an empty workspace (#821).\nüõ†Ô∏èÔ∏è Internal changes\n- Change cargo lib and bin path to enable build on WSL (#827).\n- Linting fixes and working doctests (#834, #831).\n\nBig thanks to @rpop0, @DreamMaoMao, @Miitto, @veryard, @Dovias and @michidk for contributing to this release üíõ/ @lars-berger","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"3.6.0","site":"https://github.com/glzr-io","source":"Glzr Software Pte.
