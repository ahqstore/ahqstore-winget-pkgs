The most significant fix is that ppreview --expect-no-changes now works, thus making ppreview/ppush feature complete.  Those commands will replace preview/push in 1-2 releases, so please test them and give your feedback as soon as possible.   For my configuration ppreview reduces run-time from 4-5 minutes to 30 seconds.- New record support: DESEC added SVCB/HTTPS; NS1 added SVCB, HTTPS, TLSA, DNAME, DHCID; BUNNY_DNS added ALIAS.\n- Added support for concurrent operation (ppreview/ppush): NS1, TRANSIP\n- \"ppreview --expect-no-changes\" now works!\n- ZSH Autocomplete improved\n- Welcome new maintainer for AKAMAIEDGEDNS, Ed Lynes!\nThanks to everyone for their contributions!

This is a breaking change. Warnings are output if your configuration is affected. No date has been announced for v5.0. See https://docs.dnscontrol.org/language-reference/top-level-functions/revcompat\n- MSDNS maintainer needed! Without a new volunteer, this DNS provider will lose support after April 2025.

It has been unsupported since December 2022.  If you don't use this feature, do not start. If you do use this feature, migrate ASAP.
