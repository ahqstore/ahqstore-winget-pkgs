(UUM-70751)\n- Linux: Fixed Linux New Input System (Editor and Runtime) not detecting certain keys in Non-US Layouts. (UUM-73613)\n- Physics: Fixed an issue with cloth self collision where setting and clearing self collision indices would cause simulation artifacts unless self collision distance was set to 0.0f prior to clearing. Now when clearing self collision indices distance/stiffness no longer play a role in the simulation of the cloth component. (UUM-78851)\n- Universal RP: Fixed Depth Buffer flickering during screen recording in Android Application. (UUM-77428)\n- Version Control: Fixed token renewal issue: Can't obtain a new token (Message: Invalid Refresh Token., Code: 132.104).\nPackage changes in 2022.3.50f1\nPackages updated\n- com.unity.collab-proxy: 2.5.1 to 2.5.2\n- com.unity.memoryprofiler: 1.1.0 to 1.1.1","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"2022.3.50f1c1","site":"https://unity.cn/","source":"Unity Technologies ApS","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
