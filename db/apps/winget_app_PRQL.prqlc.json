(@vanillajonathan, 4791)\n- The version of the library is now read from git describe.\n  This doesn't affect libraries built on git tags (such as our releases), only those built when developing.\n  When reporting bugs, this helps identify the exact version. (@max-sixty & @m-span, #4804)\n- Raw strings (r\"...\") are retained through prqlc fmt (@max-sixty, #4848)\n- Strings containing an odd contiguous number of quotes are now delimited by an odd number of quotes when being formatted.\n  The previous implementation would use an even number, which is invalid PRQL. (@max-sixty, #4850)\n- A few more keywords are quoted, such as user, which is a reserved keyword in PostgreSQL.
