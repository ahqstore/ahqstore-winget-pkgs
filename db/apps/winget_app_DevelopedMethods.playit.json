We do this through our custom tunneling software. You can find our opensource client here. When you launch the playit program, the program will connect to our Anycast Network and assign you a static IP and port. You can then share your static IP and port with friends. When they connect, their connection information will go to the nearest tunnel server and be tunneled to the playit program running on your computer. By tunneling the connection, your friend is able to connect to the server running within your network.\n- Rewrites how UDP works in the playit program\n- Adds support for Proxy Protocol V2 \\w UDP tunnels","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"0.15.26","site":"https://playit.gg/","source":"Developed Methods LLC","license_or_tos":"BSD-2-Clause","resources":null,"verified":false}
