I'm sorry this release took a while, but it's here. This release (including the date) was @ciciplusplus's idea, and they now have more power in the project than before. We hope you enjoy! ~ hikari_no_yume\nCompatibility:- New working apps:\n    - Rayman 2 (@ciciplusplus)\n    - Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 (@ciciplusplus)\n    - Earthworm Jim (@ciciplusplus)\n    - Castle of Magic (@ciciplusplus)\n- API support improvements:\n    - Various small contributions. (@alborrajo, @WhatAmISupposedToPutHere, @ciciplusplus, @hikari-no-yume, @LennyKappa, @Skryptonyte, @teromene)\n    - AAC audio files (AAC-LC in a typical MPEG-4 container) are now supported in Audio Toolbox. This is done in a fairly hacky way so it might not work for some apps. (@hikari-no-yume)\n- There is now support for iPhone OS 3.0 apps, in addition to the existing support for iPhone OS 2.x apps:\n    - Support for fat binaries has been added. touchHLE will no longer crash when trying to run an app with both ARMv6 and ARMv7 versions, and instead will try to pick the best available option (ARMv7, or failing this, ARMv6). This improves compatibility with iPhone OS 3.0 apps, many of which use fat binaries in order to improve performance on the iPhone 3GS and iPod touch (3rd generation). (@WhatAmISupposedToPutHere)\n    - The bundled ARMv6 dynamic libraries, libgcc and libstdc++, have been updated to their iPhone OS 3.0.1 versions. Previously the iPhone OS 2.2.1 versions were used. (@hikari-no-yume)\n    - touchHLE will no longer output a warning when trying to run an app with iPhone OS 3.0 as its minimum OS version. The warning now only appears for apps requiring iPhone OS 3.1 and later. (@hikari-no-yume)\nUsability:- The --button-to-touch= option now supports the Start and the LeftShoulder buttons in addition to the A/B/X/Y buttons and D-pad. Certain games' default options have been adjusted to use them. (@nighto)\n- Default options for various games (@nighto)","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"0.2.2","site":"https://github.com/hikari-no-yume","source":"hikari-no-yume","license_or_tos":"MPL-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
