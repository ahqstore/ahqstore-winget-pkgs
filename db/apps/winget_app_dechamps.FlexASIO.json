Other examples of universal ASIO drivers include ASIO4ALL, ASIO2KS, ASIO2WASAPI.\nThis is a hotfix release to address a regression in FlexASIO 1.10 that can result in hangs/freezes in some applications (most notably, Cycling 74' Max 8) that do not signal outputReady() for the last bufferSwitch() while stopping.
