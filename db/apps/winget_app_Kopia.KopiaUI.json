CLI and GUI included.\n\nKopia is a fast and secure open-source backup/restore tool that allows you to create encrypted snapshots of your data and save the snapshots to remote or cloud storage of your choice, to network-attached storage or server, or locally on your machine.\nKopia does not 'image' your whole machine.\nRather, Kopia allows you to backup/restore any and all files/directories that you deem are important or critical.\nKopia v0.18.0\nThere are over 240 changes in this release.
