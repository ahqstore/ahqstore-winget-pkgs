Kinda like Synaptic, but for Windows. Not associated with either Microsoft or the Synaptic project, and Microsoft does not endorse this software. If installing system-wide, you may need to run winget as an administrator to install this package due to issues where Inno Setup doesn't properly ask for UAC when installing with winget.
