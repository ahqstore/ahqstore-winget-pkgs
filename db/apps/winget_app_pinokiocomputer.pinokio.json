Keep consuming memory even when they all should be shut down\n2. Sometimes you get \"uvicorn\" related errors saying the process is still running (This is because when you closed Pinokio last time, the uvicorn server inside pinokio kept sticking around even though it should have been shut down along with Pinokio)\n3. Sometimes you can't delete folders because the folders are locked. All because the process associated with those folders are still running\nBasically this update is a critical fix if you want to use Pinokio in a stable way. No other features have been touched, just this bug fixed, so no reason not to upgrade.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"2.15.1","site":"https://github.com/pinokiocomputer","source":"https://twitter.com/cocktailpeanut","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
