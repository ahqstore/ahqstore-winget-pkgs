It allows tracking of dive locations including GPS coordinates (which can also conveniently be entered using a map interface), logging of equipment used and names of other divers, and lets users rate dives and provide additional notes. Subsurface also calculates a wide variety of statistics of the userâ€™s diving and tracks information like the SAC rate, partial pressures of O2, N2 and He, calculated deco information, and many more.\nnew feature:\n\n- implement panning of the profile\n- infobox: show an icon for warnings\n- planner: allow handle manipulation in zoomed in state\n- use combobox for moving sensor between cylinders\n- remove divesite list from tab-widgets\n\nbug fixes:\n\n- import: allow import of divesites without UUID\n- divelist: do not include planned versions of a dive if there is real data\n- fix key composition in tag widgets and dive site widget\n\ndive computer support\n\n- fix Ratio dive computer detection for BLE only devices","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"5.0.10","site":"https://github.com/subsurface/","source":"Subsurface","license_or_tos":"GPL-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
