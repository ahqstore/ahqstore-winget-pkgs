No longer will development be fragmented between these forks, and instead all progress will be made in a single coordinated effort.As a result of this, development of Lime3DS will also be discontinued, and development time after the release of the 2119 update will be focused on getting this new project off of the ground.\nOn release, the new emulator will contain features from both forks, so prior development efforts will not be lost in the transition.Further details of this new project will be shared in the coming weeks, and we hope you look forward to learning more about it.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"2119","site":"https://github.com/Lime3DS","source":"WinGet","license_or_tos":"GPL-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
